## UBU-Q0152: Allowed time range on Tasks

Status: Open Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1b Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 100 Depends on: None Blocks: UBU-Q0154, routine planning, retirement of occupies_capacity Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-09-21 Scored from commit: None

Defining context: DESIGN.md §9.2, DESIGN.md §16.5, PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §2, `UBU-D0256`, `UBU-D0275`.

### Question

What Task input expresses the range of times a Dynamic Task may occupy, and how does planning consume it?

### Subquestions

1. **Shape.** Is the range a single `{ earliest_start, latest_finish }` interval, an ordered list of movable windows like the decision envelope's `movable_windows`, or a recurring local time-of-day window such as 09:00–11:45?
2. **Input versus output.** The decision envelope (`UBU-D0256`) is derived from a Plan for mobile repair. How is the Task's declared range kept distinct from it, and from due dates and deadlines?
3. **Relation to `static_window`.** Are the two mutually exclusive, or is a Static Task a range with no slack?
4. **Hard or soft.** Must placement fall inside the range, or may it spill outside at a scored cost?
5. **Kernel mapping.** `TaskSpec` carries one per-task `window`, which the kernel intersects with the plan window. Several windows would need either a contract change or the orchestrator choosing one window per horizon.
6. **Retiring `occupies_capacity`.** The orchestrator currently refuses non-capacity Dynamic Tasks, because `occupies_capacity` is a bridge until the planner can place hard-to-schedule routine Tasks. Do allowed ranges plus the Phase 1b planner retire the field, and on what evidence?
7. **Time zones.** The planning timeline is UTC seconds. How are local time-of-day ranges converted, including across DST changes?

### Current direction

One-off Tasks carry an absolute `{ earliest_start, latest_finish }` range, which the orchestrator maps onto `TaskSpec.window`. Routine instances receive their range from the recurrence rule when they are instantiated (`UBU-Q0154`). The range is a hard constraint. Multiple movable windows are deferred. The range is a declared input, and the decision envelope stays a derived output.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-D0256: Mobile stewardship metadata uses compact envelopes and bounded local repair

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§16.5, 16.9. Resolves `UBU-Q0073`.

Mobile stewardship metadata is part of the Compact Calendar and exists to preserve current/next Task legitimacy on constrained devices without pretending to run full global optimization. The MVP record contains Task criticality, decision envelopes, shared conflict severity, cached explanation fragments, last-legitimate-Plan identity, simple repair recipe refs, next-best-action mode, recalculation triggers, and remote-assist eligibility. Learned local policy models and rich branch packaging remain post-MVP.

Task criticality has exactly three levels: `protected`, `flexible`, and `disposable`. Protected Tasks include Static Tasks, hard dependencies/preconditions, user commitments, legitimization support, recovery-critical work, and deadline-fragile work; mobile must not silently drop, shorten below minimum duration, or move them outside envelope. Flexible Tasks may be moved, split, or shortened inside envelope when constraints remain satisfied. Disposable Tasks may be omitted or replaced when doing so does not break downstream legitimacy.

Decision envelopes record the local movement boundary: earliest start, latest start, latest finish, movable windows, minimum and target duration, dependency/precondition refs, affected Static Task refs, affect/resource/location assumptions, repair budget, and staleness deadline. Local repairs are legitimate only while accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, elapsed time, and user actions keep the current/next Task inside those envelopes and do not invalidate dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, hard constraints, or coverage.

Conflict severity uses one Phase 1b vocabulary for mobile stewardship and projection conflicts: `advisory`, `minor`, `major`, and `blocking`. Advisory conflicts can be recorded as stale/degraded metadata; minor conflicts may be silently repaired inside envelopes; major conflicts require user choice or confirmation while preserving next-action explanation; blocking conflicts mean mobile cannot identify a legitimate current or next Task without clarification or higher-fidelity planning.

Cached explanation fragments are short, non-blaming strings with lineage refs for `why_now`, `matters_because`, `depends_on`, `supports`, `legitimacy_reason`, `if_skipped`, `repair_summary`, and `staleness_summary`. They should carry enough provenance to explain the current recommendation, repair, or clarification without copying private detail into more-disclosive replicas.

MVP repair recipes cover `late_task`, `skipped_task`, `fatigue_report`, `approaching_static_task`, and `missing_prerequisite`. They may condition on accepted local evidence and adjust only flexible/disposable work inside recorded envelopes, preserve Static Tasks and protected support, use next-best-action mode when no safe default exists, and produce diagnostics or clarification Tasks when required starting state is missing. They must not invent canonical state, Resources, Skills, Techniques, external facts, or user commitments.

The last legitimate Plan is stored by digest and replay cursors: Plan id/digest, generated/effective time, horizon, execution profile, legitimacy and hard-validation refs, default segment digest, UniverseState digest, Log/Snapshot/External Event cursors, Compact Calendar digest, protected Task refs, decision-envelope digest, and explanation-lineage digest. Mobile asks the user for protected changes, meaningful omissions, missing state, or major/blocking conflicts; silently repairs only explicit minor cases; and waits for desktop/cloud refinement when the issue is advisory, outside the reactive horizon, low-coverage but not current-action-critical, or requires global optimization.

## UBU-D0275: Phase 1b runs through the switch, the planner precedes sync, and later phases are renumbered

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4, §4.2, §4.7

Phase 1b is the phase in which mainline UbU reproduces the practical features of Quick UbU, the dogfooding user's working personal planner, so that Quick UbU can become legacy software. Its exit criterion is the switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU. Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data.

The switch requires planning that places routine and decomposed work better than the greedy baseline, so the planner belongs to Phase 1b. In addition to the feature ports, Phase 1b therefore includes decomposition into Containers (§9.4) whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together; an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks; partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend of §16.10, which was already the Phase 1 performance target and is delivered in Phase 1b together with its CPU reference path. Calendar-style recurrence (§7.4.1) moves to Phase 1b with this decision. The Phase 1b slice of recurrence and Task synthesis is carved out of `UBU-Q0125` when the Phase 1b planner questions are recorded.

The planner precedes multi-device sync, which remains Phase 2. Neither constrains the other. The planning engine is a pure function over `PlanningRequest` and `PlanningResponse` (§16.10.1) and never sees replicas, Devices, mutation envelopes, or Compartments; sync carries canonical state and the Plan artifacts already specified for Phase 1. Sync is not needed for the switch, because the dogfooding configuration is one desktop Device with Google Calendar as a projection surface, which is not a Device (`UBU-D0257`). Building the planner first shortens the path to the switch, starts full dogfooding of mainline sooner, and returns time to the user through more efficient daily planning.

Later phases are renumbered to remove lettered subdivisions:

| Label before `UBU-D0275` | Label after |
|---|---|
| Phase 3A | Phase 3 |
| Phase 3 | Phase 3 |
| Phase 3B | Phase 4 |
| Phase 4+ | Phase 5+ |

Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 1b, Phase 2, Phase 3+, and Post-MVP keep their labels and meanings. Earlier tickets, commits, and external documents that use the old labels are read through this map.

A phase label names the phase that implements an item. Pulling an individual item forward, as the Phase 1b rule does, re-tags that item to the implementing phase and never renumbers phases. Build order follows the phase table in §4.7.

Consequences:

- `DESIGN.md` §4 gains a Phase 1b section (§4.2) and a phase map (§4.7); Phase 2 and Phase 3 move to §4.3 and §4.4, and Phase 4 and Phase 5+ receive §4.5 and §4.6.
- The `model-committee` phase vocabulary adds `Phase 4` and `Phase 5` so that Open Questions can carry the new labels.
- Phase 2 sync scope, the Device Sync and Compartment contract, and all Phase 1 and Phase 1b decisions are unchanged.

Phase labels name the phase that implements an item. The phases, their build order, and the mapping from labels used before `UBU-D0275` are recorded in §4.7.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Single-user GitHub dogfooding

A single user uses UbU to coordinate development of UbU itself.

Primary goals:

- import or observe GitHub issues, PRs, reviews, CI events, and milestones;
- represent them in UbU’s Objective/Task/Calendar model;
- generate useful Plans;
- provide a minimal bootstrap interview that creates an initial dogfooding context, current or stale affect Snapshot, and prioritized Objective/Task seed set;
- provide a next-action focus mode that shows one recommended next Task with an inspectable explanation of why it matters now;
- update GitHub as a low-dimensional projection of UbU state;
- expose limitations and open questions through dogfooding.

The frozen Phase 1 implementation set is:

- local single-user `user_mode` instance for UbU-runs-UbU;
- bootstrap interview and explicit seed model creation;
- GitHub issue, PR, review, CI, milestone, and comment import from live data or approved fixtures;
- ExternalReference-style source links sufficient to trace imported GitHub objects;
- Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, and External Reference schemas only to the depth required by the dogfooding loop;
- schedulable Static and Dynamic Tasks with Objective links, durations, dependency/precondition/effect fields, active/completed/failed/moot lifecycle handling, and moot reason codes sufficient for the demo;
- lightweight UniverseState facts, affect Snapshot handling, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation;
- append-only per-instance Logs with correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries;
- Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation;
- next-action focus mode with start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, explain-more, and feedback controls;
- derived risk and human-complete plan-quality reports covering deadline risk, dependency fragility, worker or automation bottlenecks, stale affect, affect-margin, destructive pressure, and post-plan depletion warnings;
- minimal Compartment guardrails for `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed integration/device references, low-security labeling, and logged boundary decisions;
- Automation Worker identity, scoped capability grants, explicit assignment/status display, and mutation or projection request submission without direct canonical writes;
- Delegation Substrate-compatible Task formalization fields where needed for dogfooding, worker assignment, or solo self-reminder clarity, including purpose, executor type, authority, expected output, evidence, review, privacy scope, and escalation notes;
- clearly marked GitHub projection previews or human-approved writes for UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, plus reconciliation reporting;
- manually structured Release Outreach Pipeline work items and artifact records for release notes, screenshots, scripts, and contributor calls-to-action;
- manually structured EthConf outreach notes and follow-up artifacts that dogfood Association formation and organizational introspection without requiring full multi-user Association automation.

Phase 2 explicitly defers:

- multi-device local-first sync;
- partial replication across Devices, Zones, or Compartments;
- secure cross-device Compartment propagation;
- sync conflict handling;
- cross-device worker or enclave coordination beyond the single local instance boundary.

Phase 3 is the bridge from the bootstrap MVP toward the full personal life-logistics product. It prioritizes minimal Resource/Skill-aware task readiness, private skill-tree foundations, and narrow Identity coordination that directly improves single-user life logistics. Phase 4 (§4.5) begins the full version 1.0 release track, and Phase 5+ (§4.6) continues it.

Phase 3 explicitly includes:

- minimal Resource objects and Task resource requirements sufficient to answer whether a Task is realistically ready to start or complete;
- minimal Skill objects and Task skill requirements sufficient to answer whether the user can perform a Task, needs a refresher, should learn a prerequisite, or should consider purchase/delegation;
- minimal cross-user contextual messaging between UbU instances;
- user-to-user Identity-mediated requests, status updates, questions, commitments, and blockers;
- bounded Message Context Envelopes carrying priority, interrupt recommendation, topic, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, and disclosure policy;
- legacy-message ingestion and limited upgrade paths where both parties use UbU;
- user-to-user Identity commitments, capabilities, and limited disclosure sufficient for narrow coordination;
- early Delegation Substrate use between Identities, if Phase 2/3 authority and privacy boundaries are in place.

Phase 3 still defers:

- full inventory management, full financial management, bank syncing, investment tracking, receipt OCR, tax categorization, and Quicken-like accounting workflows;
- public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and marketplace governance;
- shared global project truth between users;
- rich subjective Relationship-model exchange;
- full Association synchronization;
- multi-party governance, invitation, revocation, or trust protocols;
- broad personal-data ingestion beyond selected communication integrations.

Phase 1 keeps these abstractions documented for compatibility but does not implement them:

- Technique as a first-class planning object;
- Resource and Skill as first-class planning objects beyond lightweight compatibility placeholders;
- full Compact Calendar planner grammar and high-coverage transport format;
- complete Zone and Device system beyond the current local execution enclave;
- organization-mode and worker-mode web admin consoles;
- richer relationship-management, personal CRM, and longitudinal affect/growth models;
- full Release Outreach Pipeline video generation, rendering, and publication workflow;
- broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion outside narrow approved dogfooding fixtures;
- full realtime multimodal capture, always-on assistant behavior, public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and General Contractor subdelegation workflows;
- adaptive model-committee weighting, automatic patch application, GitHub mutation, and direct cloud-provider APIs.

Stop rule:

> A new abstraction may be added to Phase 1 only when it is required to complete the single-user GitHub dogfooding loop, enforce an accepted hard invariant, or avoid a known irreversible schema contradiction. Otherwise it must be documented as a Phase 2, Phase 3, or post-MVP concern and must not block Phase 1 implementation.

After `UBU-D0175`, new MVP blockers are allowed only when discovered during implementation of a concrete Phase 1 slice and accompanied by a blocker certificate naming the blocked object or file, failed acceptance criterion, unsafe fallback, minimum answer needed, and persistence impact. Phase 1 readiness is judged slice-by-slice rather than by global philosophical completion of the model.

### 4.1.0 Phase 1 readiness scoring

Phase 1 readiness is a derived, evidence-backed, human-reviewed signal. It reports `scope_freeze_readiness` and `mvp_readiness` from per-slice evidence, gates, and score caps rather than from raw open-question count or model confidence. Unresolved nonblocking questions do not reduce Phase 1 readiness after `UBU-D0175` unless they carry a valid blocker certificate. Model-committee may compute readiness reports and propose README readiness text, but it must not publish or update public readiness signals automatically. The accepted rubric is `UBU-D0189`.

The minimum dogfooding loop that proves UbU’s core model is:

1. bootstrap the operator, project context, available work window, constraints, and current or stale affect Snapshot;
2. import or load a curated UbU GitHub fixture with issues, PR/review/CI signals, milestone context, and source links;
3. map those inputs into Objectives, Tasks, External Events, Logs, UniverseState facts, and External References;
4. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
5. present one recommended next Task with an explanation of Objective value, dependencies, deadlines, affect constraints, worker status, and risk findings;
6. record completion, failure, snooze, rejection, decomposition, or override as Log evidence and trigger recalculation when appropriate;
7. preview or perform a human-approved UbU-managed GitHub projection update;
8. show a reconciliation or risk summary that makes the changed model inspectable.

### 4.1.1 Phase 1 public demo criteria

The Phase 1 public demo should use real UbU GitHub issues or a frozen fixture captured from real UbU GitHub data when live access is unsafe, unavailable, or non-reproducible.

The smallest persuasive demo is an end-to-end single-user dogfooding loop:

1. import a curated set of UbU issues, PR/review/CI signals, and milestone context;
2. map those inputs into Objectives, schedulable Tasks, External Events, and traceable source links;
3. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
4. show why the Plan was chosen, including dependencies and worker assignment or worker status;
5. show user-mode affect constraints by applying a current affect Snapshot or by creating an affect-collection Task when affect data is stale or missing;
6. write or preview clearly marked UbU-managed GitHub projection labels, comments, or managed blocks;
7. show a risk summary covering at least deadline risk, dependency fragility, and worker or automation bottlenecks.

The demo must not require Phase 2 sync, Phase 3 multi-user coordination, full RBAC, a complete Compact Calendar UI, or autonomous remote GitHub mutation. If live GitHub writes are unsafe for the public recording, a dry-run projection is acceptable only when it shows the exact payload that would be written after human approval.

### 4.1.2 Phase 1 user-facing loop

Phase 1 must include a minimal first-person UX loop for dogfooding. The loop is intentionally narrow: it collects explicit answers, creates explicit UbU objects, recommends one next Task, records what happened, and recalculates from Logs and current state.

1. **Bootstrap interview**
   - Ask exactly the minimum questions needed to seed the first dogfooding Plan:
     1. `What are you trying to move forward right now?`
     2. `Which project context should UbU use for this first session?`
     3. `How much usable time do you have for the next work window?`
     4. `Is there a deadline, meeting, release target, or external event that changes what matters today?`
     5. `What work should UbU consider first?`
     6. `What is already blocked, unavailable, or not worth recommending right now?`
     7. `How are your energy, stress, and mood right now?`
     8. `When choosing between useful work, what should UbU favor today?`
   - Record the project/context answer as UniverseState facts and source-linked Logs.
   - Record available time, static commitments, deadlines, and immediate constraints as UniverseState facts, Tasks, External Events, or Logs.
   - Record affect answers as a user-declared Snapshot, or create an affect-collection Task when the user skips or the data is stale.
   - Record favored tradeoffs as Preferences only when the user accepts an explicit Preference statement; otherwise retain them as Log notes or Objective annotations.
   - Seed a small Objective/Task set from user answers plus approved GitHub fixtures or configured imports.

2. **Minimum data for one recommendation**
   - A user or operator Identity.
   - At least one active Objective.
   - At least one active schedulable Task linked to that Objective with title and duration or work-window estimate.
   - A current work window or next available time.
   - Current or explicitly stale affect state.
   - Known hard blockers, deadlines, dependencies, and source references for the recommended Task when available.
   - If this minimum is missing, the next recommended Task should be a clarification, import, or affect-collection Task rather than pretending to optimize.

3. **Plan generation**
   - Generate a candidate default Plan from explicit modeled state.
   - Preserve inspectability of the full Plan.
   - Explain relevant Objective value, constraints, dependencies, deadlines, risk findings, worker status, and affect constraints.
   - Mark any fixture-backed, hardcoded, or mock recommendation path directly in the UI and run artifact.

4. **Calendar preview**
   - Treat Calendar preview as a notable recurring Task.
   - Default cadence is before the first recommended Task in a user-declared work window and after a material Calendar regeneration when UbU is about to rely on the new default Plan.
   - Let the user inspect the candidate Calendar or default Plan before relying on it.
   - Ask whether the Plan feels plausible, motivating, humane, and consistent with the user's current context.
   - Ask only lightweight model-repair questions about expected execution, perceived control, social pressure, and missing context; store raw psychological comments as review notes unless the user accepts a concrete canonical update.
   - Allow the user to correct Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, affect Snapshots, availability, or estimates before execution.
   - Let the user snooze, skip, or adjust Calendar-preview cadence through the cadence rule on its evergreen system Objective (§7.4.1).

5. **Next-action focus mode**
   - Present one recommended next Task as the default UI surface.
   - Show title, Objective link, estimated duration or work window, current status, and source/provenance label.
   - Show `why this matters now` with at least the served Objective, timing reason, main dependency or blocker status, affect/staleness status, and top risk or opportunity considered.
   - Show what UbU considered, including visible counts or links for candidate Tasks, blocked Tasks, hard constraints, affect constraints, worker/projection state, and imported or fixture sources.
   - Provide controls for start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, override, and explain more.
   - Keep full Plan inspection one action away through a Plan drawer, timeline, or inspector that shows ordered Tasks, assumptions, source links, and explanation fragments.
   - One-task focus reduces cognitive load; it must not hide the Plan, turn the recommendation into opaque automation, or imply that the user has committed to the default Plan.

6. **Feedback, Log review, and recalculation**
   - After `done`, ask whether completion matched the estimate, whether the modeled effect happened, and whether energy or stress changed enough to update the Snapshot.
   - After failure or blocked execution, ask what assumption failed: missing dependency, wrong duration, stale affect, interruption, unclear Task, changed priority, or other.
   - After snooze, ask for the next review time or condition and whether the reason is timing, affect, dependency, or user preference.
   - After rejection, ask whether the Task is wrong, not valuable now, blocked, too large, already done, duplicate, or should become moot.
   - After override, record the chosen Task or action, the reason if supplied, and whether the override should update Preferences, availability, Task estimates, Objective status, or only this Plan.
   - Treat Log review as a notable recurring Task. Default cadence is at the end of a work window or at the next startup when there are unreconciled deviations, with a weekly catch-up if routine review is skipped.
   - Store reviewed outcomes as canonical updates only when they change Logs, Snapshots, Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, or recalculation triggers; otherwise keep autonomy, competence, relatedness, attitude, subjective-norm, perceived-control, and expected-execution comments as noncanonical review notes or derived report inputs.
   - Record outcomes as Logs and trigger recalculation when the outcome changes Task status, availability, affect state, dependencies, Objective status, or user Preferences.
   - Treat failure, rejection, override, and deviation as model evidence, not user blame.

7. **Discovery mode when appropriate**
   - Allow the user to choose discovery mode at any time.
   - Show active, paused, ended, and pending-review state, enabled sources, routing or retention limits, and evidence count.
   - Provide pause, resume, exit, inspect, reject, delete, and review controls.
   - Collect only enabled Phase 1 evidence such as quick notes, user-selected current action, Calendar context, configured integration events, coarse motion or location category, focus state, and app-state category.
   - Treat inferred observations as reviewable evidence, not final truth; defer ambiguous interpretation until Log review or user-visible reconciliation.

The Phase 1 version may be simple and fixture-backed. Fixture behavior must be labeled as fixture behavior, mock recommendations must not be described as implemented planning, and public demos should show the exact boundary between explicit UbU objects, approved fixtures, and implemented planner behavior. The public demonstration pattern is bootstrap, one recommended next Task, explanation, user feedback, recalculation, and full-Plan inspection. It does not require broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion. It must not claim complete life-modeling, therapeutic authority, autonomous life coaching, complete planning automation, full privacy isolation, Phase 2 sync, or Phase 3 multi-user coordination. The purpose is to demonstrate the core UbU experience: one meaningful next action, with an explanation, grounded in explicit state.

### 4.1.3 Release Outreach Pipeline dogfooding

The Release Outreach Pipeline should become part of ordinary UbU-runs-UbU release management. A minor release should produce a release outreach package when the current project state contains enough user-visible, developer-visible, or contributor-visible change to justify public explanation.

The Phase 1 package is manual but structured. Minimum package artifacts are:

- `manifest.json` with release, source, Identity, Compartment, status, and hash metadata;
- `claim_register.json` with audience, support status, evidence refs, and review state for each public claim;
- `evidence_index.json` for source artifacts, hashes, selectors, and provenance;
- release-note, script, narration/caption, announcement, and publication-metadata drafts when relevant;
- `media_refs.json` for approved screenshots, UI-test exports, fixture captures, or recordings;
- `export_review.json`, `approvals.json`, and `publication_plan.json`;
- known-limitations, future-work, and contributor call-to-action notes tied to real artifacts.

Media provenance records must distinguish approved live captures, approved fixture/synthetic captures, UI-test exports, and mock/demo-only captures. Every claim in scripts, release notes, and public posts links to claim-register evidence and uses the support labels accepted in `UBU-D0180`.

Phase 1 dogfooding may generate text drafts, collect approved screenshots or recordings, assemble a publication plan, and record human approvals. It may use local renderers or LLM/script workers only as Automation Workers that produce candidate artifacts under capability grants.

Post-MVP work includes automatic UI capture generation, demo-flow export, script drafting from repository state, narration and caption generation, thumbnail generation, video rendering automation, platform upload, social posting, mailing-list publication, analytics feedback, and trusted auto-publication policies.

The full video-generation and publication pipeline remains future work. Phase 1 should generate reviewable communication artifacts before trying to automate external publication.

### 4.1.4 EthConf outreach as Association-introspection dogfooding

EthConf outreach is a Phase 1 dogfooding workflow for Association formation and organizational introspection.

Phase 1 represents the workflow with ordinary Objectives, Tasks, Logs, External Events, External References, Release Outreach package artifacts, public dogfooding review packages, and manually reviewed candidate AssociationAttestations. It does not require full Association automation, multi-user Association sync, automatic contact analysis, or broad message/archive ingestion.

Minimum evidence set:

- canonical design files and accepted decisions;
- public dogfooding artifacts such as model-committee review packages, selected patches, issue fixtures, release outreach packages, and public retrospectives;
- structured EthConf outreach notes with private details separated from redacted public summaries;
- follow-up Tasks, missed follow-ups, public replies, contributor/funder/design-partner next actions, and outcome Logs.

Minimum outputs:

- candidate AssociationAttestations about declared project mission, outreach commitments, observed follow-through, and evidence gaps;
- mission-alignment questions, especially whether outreach behavior supports the privacy-first self-governance, contributor-recruitment, workflow-discovery, and compatible-funding goals;
- priority-drift observations and commitment-mismatch notes;
- follow-up Tasks with owners, review dates, evidence refs, and public/private disclosure labels;
- redacted retrospective notes suitable for public dogfooding artifacts.

The core review prompt is: `Does UbU's actual outreach behavior prove, from reviewable evidence, that the project pursued its stated goals?` The answer may be yes, no, mixed, or insufficient evidence, and must cite evidence or gaps rather than model confidence alone.

Public artifacts expose only redacted summaries, evidence selectors, hashes, public links, reviewed claims, and approved follow-up Tasks. They must not expose private notes, raw contact details, unapproved conversation content, private funding terms, private relationship hypotheses, or Compartment-protected payloads.

Acceptance criteria: the workflow produces one evidence-backed retrospective, at least one candidate AssociationAttestation or explicit no-evidence finding, at least one mission-alignment question, any needed follow-up Tasks, an export review, and a public-safe redacted artifact that labels fixture/manual/LLM-assisted content. A human reviewer must be able to trace each public claim to evidence or to a recorded evidence gap.

### 4.1.5 Optional VoxPopuli EthConf demo

UbU may optionally demonstrate a **VoxPopuli** flow at EthConf if it does not displace higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, or funder deliverables. In this flow, a user speaks freely about what they wish would happen or what feels disorganized. An LLM-assisted extractor converts that natural-language input into candidate Objectives, Tasks, constraints, preferences, and planning assumptions for the user to inspect, correct, accept, or reject.

VoxPopuli is a trust-building outreach hook, not a replacement for the narrow Phase 1 bootstrap interview. It should demonstrate how LLMs can help structure abstract human concerns while UbU remains the explicit, inspectable planning system.

### 4.1.6 Phase 1 implementation priority order

Phase 1 implementation proceeds in this priority order:

1. Remove all in-memory orchestrator state (`MemoryState`) and fully implement `ubu_store` as the canonical local admission and persistence path for the running loop.
2. Log event vocabulary: correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries.
3. UniverseState facts.
4. Affect Snapshot content, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation.
5. Structured bootstrap interview with seed Objective, Task, and Snapshot creation.
6. Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation.
7. Activate `ubu_github_adapter` as a functioning orchestrator dependency for import, projection preview, approved writes, and reconciliation.

The remaining §4.1 frozen-set items follow in bootstrap-dependency-driven ordering: persistence and vocabulary precede the features that must reference them.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0241`).** Step 3 (UniverseState facts) is foundationally realized, together with the accepted mutation vocabulary and deterministic precondition evaluation named in step 4, implemented as the §11 container and pure `ubu-core` semantics and persisted by `ubu-store`. The precondition, effect, and bootstrap-fact wiring of these facts into the loop is realized across Wiring-A/B/C (`UBU-D0242`): preconditions gate planning, a completed Task's effects mutate the facts, and the bootstrap records the initial facts under the `UBU-D0243` namespace convention. Step 4's affect-Snapshot content and step 5's interactive bootstrap interview remain.

### 4.2 Phase 1b: Quick UbU merge through the switch

Phase 1b extends the Phase 1 system until it can replace Quick UbU, the separately developed personal planner that serves as the dogfooding user's working daily tool, so that Quick UbU becomes legacy software (`UBU-D0275`).

Exit criterion:

> The switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU.

Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data.

**The Phase 1b rule.** Every Quick UbU feature merged into mainline adopts the restrictions, forms, and functional boundaries of the MVP design it corresponds to, even when that design's implementation phase is later. Open questions that block Phase 1b are answered during Phase 1b whatever phase they were previously tagged, and the items they pull forward are re-tagged Phase 1b.

Phase 1b includes:

- the Phase 1b foundations already decided, including sync-ready mutation envelopes, the Device registry, tombstones, redacted Handles, projection-conflict repair, Device-local credentials, the local advisory worker, advisory batches, and first-class advisory candidate review;
- the Quick UbU practical features, ported under the Phase 1b rule;
- the planner the switch requires: decomposition into Containers whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together (§9.4); an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks (§7.4.1); partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend with its CPU reference path (§16.10).

Phase 1b defers multi-device sync and everything else assigned to Phase 2 and later.

### 4.3 Phase 2: Single-user multi-device synchronization

A single user runs UbU across multiple Devices / execution enclaves.

Phase 2 validates:

- local-first sync;
- partial replication;
- Zone and Compartment boundaries;
- device roles;
- conflict handling;
- user-owned worker execution on the user's laptop, desktop, or other trusted personal compute device.

Design rubric:

> Phase 2 should feel like multi-agent coordination, but all agents happen to agree.

A Phase 2 personal worker is not a mandatory cloud dependency. It is an optional execution backend for a user's own UbU instance. It may provide more CPU, GPU, memory, storage, network availability, or battery-independent runtime than the mobile device while preserving the user's practical control over the compute environment.

### 4.4 Phase 3: Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination

Multiple humans coordinate through explicit Identities, capabilities, limited disclosure, and commitments.

Phase 3 should enable coordination without surveillance or shared global truth.

### 4.5 Phase 4: Version 1.0 release track

Phase 4 begins the full version 1.0 release track. It expands Resource and Skill usability, Technique-database integration, DIY-versus-purchase/hire planning, and the user-facing capability graph without requiring the public Skill Barter marketplace.

### 4.6 Phase 5+: Version 1.0+ release track

Phase 5+ continues the full version 1.0+ track with mature inventory, financial-management extensions, public or federated Skill Barter, reputation/evidence, dispute workflows, and other multi-party marketplace features.

### 4.7 Phase map and build order

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | ETHConf NYC demo | Complete |
| Phase 1 | Single-user GitHub dogfooding (§4.1) | Feature-complete |
| Phase 1b | Quick UbU merge through the switch, including the planner (§4.2) | In progress |
| Phase 2 | Single-user multi-device synchronization (§4.3) | Next |
| Phase 3 | Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination and Resource/Skill task readiness (§4.4) | Planned |
| Phase 4 | Version 1.0 release track (§4.5) | Planned |
| Phase 5+ | Version 1.0+ release track (§4.6) | Planned |

Phases are built in table order. A phase label names the phase that implements an item; pulling an item forward re-tags that item and never renumbers phases (`UBU-D0275`). Labels used before `UBU-D0275` map as follows: Phase 3A becomes Phase 3, Phase 3B becomes Phase 4, and Phase 4+ becomes Phase 5+.

#### DESIGN.md §9.2 — Task

```markdown
### 9.2 Task

A **Task** is a schedulable WorkItem.

Tasks may be:

- Static Task
- Dynamic Task

#### Static Task

A Static Task has fixed start and end times.

Examples:

- meeting
- class
- appointment

Static Tasks are included directly in Plans.

#### Dynamic Task

A Dynamic Task has flexible scheduling.

Dynamic Tasks may have:

- duration or duration PDF
- dependencies
- preconditions
- effects
- Objective link
- success probability
- affect delta
- expected cost

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0239`).** A Phase 1 Task carries an optional `duration_estimate` — either a fixed scalar or the §3 three-point shifted-log-normal (`min_seconds`/`mode_seconds`/`p95_seconds`) — and optional `correlation_groups` membership, defaulting to a fixed estimate and independence when absent. These are the per-Task duration uncertainty and correlation inputs the planning rollout consumes; the store admits and persists them, and the orchestrator carries them into the kernel `TaskSpec`.
```

#### DESIGN.md §16.5 — Mobile stewardship metadata

```markdown
### 16.5 Mobile stewardship metadata

A compact Calendar should carry metadata that lets constrained devices preserve legitimacy without performing full global replanning. Useful metadata includes:

- protected, flexible, and disposable Task criticality;
- decision envelopes such as earliest start, latest finish, and movable windows;
- cached explanations for why a Task matters and what depends on it;
- conflict severity levels;
- last-legitimate-Plan references;
- simple repair recipes;
- recovery-critical and deadline-fragile markers;
- recalculation triggers and remote-assist eligibility.

The MVP-friendly subset is Task criticality, last legitimate Plan storage, simple repair rules, conflict severity levels, cached explanations, next-best-action mode, and basic decision envelopes. Rich branch packaging and learned local policy models are post-MVP by default.

**Phase 1b mobile stewardship schema (`UBU-D0256`).** A compact Calendar stores `mobile_stewardship_metadata` for each Task or Plan segment that mobile may recommend, move, omit, or explain. The record is compact and by reference where possible; it contains `criticality`, `decision_envelope`, `conflict_severity`, `explanation_fragments`, `repair_recipe_refs`, and optional `recalculation_triggers` and `remote_assist_eligible`. Rich branch packaging, learned local policy, and global re-optimization remain outside MVP.

Task criticality is:

- `protected`: required for hard Calendar Logic, Static Tasks, prerequisites, dependencies, full legitimization support, recovery or safety, or a user-declared must-do commitment. Mobile must not silently drop it, shorten it below its minimum duration, or move it outside its envelope.
- `flexible`: legitimate to move, split, or shorten within its envelope when dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, and hard constraints remain satisfied. Mobile may silently repair flexible Tasks only when the resulting conflict severity is `minor`.
- `disposable`: optional or opportunistic work that may be skipped, replaced by an eligible next-best action, or left for desktop/cloud refinement when doing so does not break protected or flexible downstream commitments.

The MVP criticality object is `criticality: { level, reason_refs, recovery_critical, deadline_fragile, min_duration_seconds, user_confirmation_required, disposal_effect }`. `level` is one of `protected`, `flexible`, or `disposable`; `reason_refs` point to Objectives, Static Tasks, dependencies, preconditions, legitimization support, user commitments, or risk findings; `disposal_effect` is a short enum-or-string summary such as `none`, `lost_optional_value`, `missed_deadline_risk`, or `breaks_dependency`.

The MVP decision envelope is `decision_envelope: { earliest_start, latest_start, latest_finish, movable_windows, min_duration_seconds, target_duration_seconds, dependency_refs, precondition_refs, affected_static_refs, affect_assumption_refs, resource_or_location_refs, repair_budget_seconds, stale_after }`. `movable_windows` is an ordered list of `{ start, end }` intervals in which the Task may begin or occupy time, depending on the Task's duration fields. Empty or absent movable windows mean the Task is fixed or must be handled by hard Calendar Logic rather than local motion.

The shared conflict severity vocabulary is:

- `advisory`: stale or degraded metadata exists, but the current and next recommendation remain legitimate.
- `minor`: a local repair inside recorded envelopes preserves all protected commitments and can be undone or inspected later.
- `major`: the current or next recommendation remains explainable, but the user must choose, confirm, or supply missing information before mobile changes a protected commitment or meaningful tradeoff.
- `blocking`: mobile cannot identify a legitimate current or next Task because a hard constraint, Static Task, precondition, dependency, affect legitimacy requirement, or required starting state is violated or unknown.

This severity vocabulary is also the Phase 1b projection-conflict vocabulary: projection-specific classes may map into these severities, but must not invent a parallel severity ladder without a later decision.

**Phase 1b projection conflict policy (`UBU-D0261`).** Projection reconciliation uses the sync conflict class `projection_conflict` with projection-specific quadrants: `known_object_edited`, `known_object_deleted`, `unknown_object_appeared`, and `expected_object_absent`. Automatic handling is allowed only when the result is deterministic, idempotent, within projection policy and decision envelopes, and does not choose between canonical user intent, protected Calendar ownership, or independently changed third-party truth.

The quadrant defaults are:

- `known_object_edited`: auto-resolvable only for non-authority metadata repair or for a permitted edit inside the object's explicit decision envelope. A duration edit to a flexible or disposable Dynamic Task may be `minor` when minimum duration, dependencies, affect assumptions, and Static Tasks remain valid; an edit that pins or moves a Dynamic Task to an external wall-clock time is `major` unless the projection policy already granted that editable window. Protected, Static, dependency-bearing, or precondition-affecting edits are `major` or `blocking`.
- `known_object_deleted`: never silently tombstones or removes the canonical object. If the object is already tombstoned, withdrawn from the projection window, or awaiting idempotent projection deletion, the absence may be `advisory`; otherwise deletion of an active canonical object is `major`, or `blocking` when current/next legitimacy depends on it.
- `unknown_object_appeared`: is contained as external evidence, import candidate, or projection diagnostic rather than admitted canonical state. It remains `advisory` or `minor` when it does not claim a user commitment or protected slot; it becomes `major` when accepting it would create or override a commitment, dependency, Static Task, or third-party-truth assertion.
- `expected_object_absent`: is `advisory` when explained by tombstone, policy/window rotation, or completed projection deletion; it may be `minor` when UbU can retry or recreate the projection idempotently without overriding external truth. It is `major` or `blocking` when the missing external object affects a protected commitment, a current/next recommendation, a required precondition, or Calendar validity.

Every automatic projection repair emits an auditable `projection_conflict_event` record with the conflict id, projection surface, quadrant, severity, canonical object ref when any, external object ref or redacted handle when allowed, observed object and policy versions, external delta digest, action taken, candidate refs when relevant, resulting mutation or projection-operation refs, and recorded time. If the action admits canonical state, it uses the ordinary mutation-envelope or tombstone path; otherwise it remains projection state, diagnostic state, or candidate metadata and is not a silent canonical mutation.

When an external delta touches the same object as a still-pending candidate, admission compares both against the candidate's observed versions before either is accepted. Exact duplicates collapse; deterministic non-overlapping deltas may update the pending candidate's provenance or candidate mutation proposal. Overlapping deltas quarantine or supersede the candidate and surface a `major` review diagnostic, escalating to `blocking` when current/next legitimacy depends on resolving it. External projection evidence cannot force a pending candidate into admitted state.

Cached explanation fragments are short, non-blaming strings with lineage refs. MVP fragments are `why_now`, `matters_because`, `depends_on`, `supports`, `legitimacy_reason`, `if_skipped`, `repair_summary`, and `staleness_summary`. Each fragment may reference Task ids, Objective refs, dependency/precondition refs, Static Task refs, risk finding refs, and compact Calendar provenance, but should avoid copying private details into more-disclosive replicas.

A repair recipe record is `repair_recipe: { trigger, applies_to_refs, eligible_when, steps, ask_policy, fallback, explanation_fragment_ref }`. MVP triggers are:

- `late_task`: condition on elapsed time and accepted Logs; keep protected Tasks and Static Tasks fixed, compress or drop only flexible/disposable work inside envelopes, then offer the next valid Dynamic Task or next-best action. Escalate to `major` or `blocking` if a protected latest finish, hard precondition, or Static Task would be violated.
- `skipped_task`: for disposable Tasks, record omission and continue; for flexible Tasks, reschedule within the envelope; for protected Tasks, ask before omission or create a blocking diagnostic if no legitimate alternate exists.
- `fatigue_report`: record the user report as a Log/Snapshot input, protect recovery-critical Tasks, reduce to protected and low-affect eligible work, and surface rest or clarification when affect assumptions no longer support the Plan.
- `approaching_static_task`: preserve the Static Task, insert required transition/setup/teardown if already modeled, stop or park the current Task when necessary, and ask when the remaining time cannot satisfy a protected current Task.
- `missing_prerequisite`: re-evaluate the deterministic precondition/dependency chain; if a modeled prerequisite Task is available, schedule or pull it forward inside its envelope; otherwise show a clarification Task or blocking prompt. Mobile must not invent a satisfied state, Resource, Skill, Technique, or external fact.

The last legitimate Plan record is `last_legitimate_plan: { plan_id, plan_digest, generated_at, effective_time, horizon, execution_profile, legitimacy_result_ref, hard_validation_ref, default_segment_digest, universe_state_digest, log_cursor, snapshot_refs, external_event_cursor, compact_calendar_digest, protected_task_refs, decision_envelope_digest, explanation_lineage_digest }`. Mobile compares current reality to this record by replaying accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, elapsed time, and user actions since the recorded cursors, then checking whether current and next Task placements remain inside decision envelopes with dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, Static Tasks, and coverage still valid.

Mobile may silently repair only for `minor` conflicts where the recipe is explicit, all changes stay inside decision envelopes, protected Tasks and support Tasks are preserved, failed preconditions are not hidden, and the explanation cache remains accurate enough for next-action display. Mobile asks the user for `major` conflicts, protected/discretionary tradeoffs, missing starting state, meaningful omission, or any repair that would change a user commitment. Mobile waits for desktop/cloud refinement or marks the Calendar stale when the issue is advisory, outside the reactive horizon, low coverage but not current-action-critical, or requires global optimization. It enters next-best-action mode when there is no safe default but there is at least one legitimate local Task or clarification Task to show.
```

#### DESIGN.md §16.9 — MVP Compact Calendar implementation

```markdown
### 16.9 MVP Compact Calendar implementation

The minimum Phase 1 Compact Calendar implementation stores the legitimized skeleton baseline, the default Plan, the active execution profile, coverage estimate, uncovered-mass estimate, effective coverage threshold, decision envelopes, Task criticality, conflict severity, cached explanation fragments, simple repair recipes, probability provenance, and last-legitimate-Plan record. It stores user-previewed, risk-report, and debug/reproducibility Plans only when those artifacts are actually generated or needed for audit.

High-probability near-term alternatives within the reactive horizon may be stored as materialized branches or as deterministic reconstruction instructions. Non-selected candidate Plans, expensive global repairs, and low-probability branches are reconstructed on demand from the compact grammar, current UniverseState, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, repair recipes, and cached provenance.

MVP planning does not require exhaustive optimal search, cloud compute, GPU execution, exact coverage proof, learned policy models, or a complete transport grammar for every post-MVP uncertainty source. The required implementation is a deterministic skeletonizer, minimum legitimizer, greedy baseline, bounded candidate expansion, hard-constraint validator, Plan probability/provenance record, compact default-Plan package, short-horizon repair cache or reconstruction path, and low-coverage recalculation trigger.
```

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.

- `horizon_policy`:
  - `reactive_horizon_seconds`: positive integer. Phase 1 default is `3600`.
  - `branch_coverage_target`: float in `(0, 1]`. The CPU supplies the effective value after Calendar, execution-profile, Device, and global policy resolution. Phase 1 default is `0.99`.
- `compute_budget`:
  - `max_planning_tasks`: positive integer. Phase 1 default is `256`.
  - `n_candidates`: positive integer chosen by the CPU kernel.

- `task_graph`:
  - `tasks`: ordered list of `TaskSpec` objects.
  - `dependency_edges`: list of directed edges `{before_task_id, after_task_id}`.
  - `topological_order`: CPU-provided topological task ID list. The CPU validates the DAG and the GPU engine does not perform its own topological sort.
- `universe_state_snapshot`:
  - `snapshot_id`.
  - `snapshot_effective_time`.
  - `state_refs` or compact state facts needed by the planner.

- `constraint_policy`:
  - `hard_constraints_always_required`: must be `true`.
  - `affect_constraint_mode`: enum, one of `enforce`, `warn_only`. Phase 1 default is `enforce` in user-facing contexts and `warn_only` in non-user-facing test fixtures or explicit onboarding/debug contexts.
- `privacy_and_provenance`:
  - `compartment_ids`: list of compartment IDs represented in the request.
  - `redaction_level`: enum or policy label.
  - `payload_safety_proof`: CPU-generated assertion that no denied Compartment data, forbidden identity disclosure, export-banned data, or integration-prohibited data is included.
  - `payload_verified_safe`: derived boolean that must be true before dispatch; it is not a substitute for `payload_safety_proof`.

### Optional fields

- `external_event_assumptions`: list of structured stochastic or fixed external event assumptions. Defaults to empty.
- `repair_context`: required when `mode = repair`, absent otherwise.
  - `prior_plan_id`
  - `last_legitimate_plan_ref`
  - `observed_divergence_refs`
  - `repair_scope`: enum, one of `local`, `remaining_window`, `full_window`.
- `explanation_request`:
  - `include_rejection_summary`: boolean.
  - `include_score_breakdown`: boolean.
  - `include_user_facing_fragments`: boolean.
- `debug_flags`: implementation-specific diagnostic toggles. Must not change canonical semantics.

### Deferred fields

The Phase 1 contract deliberately defers mobile GPU targets, cloud GPU provider metadata, encrypted-compute metadata, cross-user coordination payloads, realtime stream state, and premium wide-horizon planning-provider negotiation. These may be added later without changing the Phase 1 CPU/GPU authority boundary.

Solver/library identity is not part of `PlanningRequest`. Optional OR-Tools, SMT/MaxSMT, local-search, mobile GPU, cloud GPU, or learned-model backends must preserve this request/response contract and remain advisory until CPU certification.

### Phase 3 note: Objective expansion is pre-kernel; `scoring_policy` carries trade-off weights

The Phase 3 Objective-to-Task expansion and technicalizing stage (DESIGN.md §15.2.1.1) runs on the CPU side **before** this contract is invoked. The kernel continues to receive a fully materialized `task_graph`; it does not expand Objectives, select Techniques, or consult any advisory model. This preserves the fixed `task_graph` input, the CPU-provided `topological_order`, the absence of Objectives/Techniques from `PlanningRequest`, and the kernel's determinism and no-I/O guarantee. Alternative Technique instantiations enter as separate candidates (either enumerated CPU-side and scored independently, or, if a later schema adds them, as mutually-exclusive choice-group nodes the kernel selects among deterministically — see `UBU-Q0125` subquestion 3).

The existing `scoring_policy` weights (`utility_weight`, `robustness_weight`, `affect_margin_weight`, `schedule_diversity_weight`) are the parameterization point for the user's trade-off preferences in multi-Technique outcome comparison (DESIGN.md §16.3.1). A user's revealed choice may **propose** an update to these weights for explicit user acceptance; the kernel itself neither learns nor mutates them, consistent with `UBU-D0217`.

- Every hunk must include accurate `@@ -old_start,old_count +new_start,new_count @@` ranges and enough unchanged context for `git apply --check` to apply without `--recount`.
- When editing `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, anchor hunks with the selected question heading `## UBU-Q0152: Allowed time range on Tasks` and its own `### Resolution` section. Do not use a repeated `### Resolution` heading from an earlier or later question as the edit location.
- If resolving the selected question, replace the `Unresolved.` text under that selected question's `### Resolution` section and update that same question's metadata line. Do not insert selected-question resolution text into any other question block.
- Use the existing `UBU-Qxxxx` and `UBU-Dxxxx` numbering conventions.
- Prefer minimal, auditable changesets.
- If the selected question is blocked, propose decomposition only if it produces replacement questions with fewer, simpler, or no dependencies.
- If the selected question is already partially resolved, narrow or clarify it rather than pretending it is fully unresolved.
