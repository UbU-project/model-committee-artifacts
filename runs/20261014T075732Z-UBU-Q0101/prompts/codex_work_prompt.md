## UBU-Q0101: Advisory safeguard uncertainty, override, and introspection consequences

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0100 Blocks: safeguard UX, introspection, relationship-transition UX Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-10-14 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should advisory behavioral safeguards represent uncertainty, false-positive risk, user override, and introspection consequences without becoming paternalistic gates?

### Subquestions

1. How should UbU communicate classifier uncertainty and false-positive/false-negative risk?
2. What UI should allow review, revision, bypass-once, disablement, or user-configured required gates?
3. How should bypass decisions become candidate introspection evidence without becoming soft coercion?
4. How should safeguard disablement interact with declared values around respect, care, autonomy, safety, and trust?
5. When should repeated bypasses trigger review of the user's values or preferences?

### Current direction

Advisory safeguards should be default-on, user-aware, uncertainty-transparent, overrideable, and introspection-relevant when bypassed.

### Resolution

Open.

## Patch baseline

The patch must apply to the **current working-tree files** in the repository above.
The selected question and context excerpts come from that working tree, which may
include uncommitted ranking and metadata updates.

- Set the JSON `base_commit` field to `4ceb0ef3797c1cbf3e7a7edd33835404105037e1` for provenance. It does not
  define the patch's file contents: do not use `git show HEAD:<path>` or the Git index
  as the original version when it differs from the working tree.
- Use exact working-tree lines for all removed and unchanged lines. Preserve existing
  metadata updates and exclude unrelated edits from the proposal.
- To generate the diff, compare unmodified working-tree copies with the proposed
  contents. Validate against the working tree with `git apply --check`; a successful
  `git apply --check --cached` checks the index and is insufficient.

## Canonical design context

The excerpts below are **not** the whole canonical files. They are the subset selected by
following references from the selected question: its dependencies, the decisions those
questions cite, and the sections those cite in turn.

Read them under these rules:

- **Absence is not non-existence.** Ids and sections you cannot see here still exist.
  Never conclude that a question is unasked, a decision unmade, or a section absent
  because it is not shown.
- **Do not renumber or reuse ids.** Allocate new entries from the next free ids below.
- **Patch context must match the real file.** Hunks are applied against the full files,
  not against these excerpts, and `git apply` locates them by surrounding context. Quote
  surrounding lines exactly as they appear here.
- **Scope your edits to what you can see.** Do not delete or rewrite text on the
  assumption that it duplicates something outside these excerpts.

Next free ids — use these for anything you add:

- next question id: `UBU-Q0191`
- next decision id: `UBU-D0356`

`DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` is read-only context and is not in the patch
allowlist: do not propose changes to it.

## UBU-D0074: Phase 1 privacy promise is a minimal Compartment guardrail layer

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0028`.

Phase 1 implements Compartments as metadata-backed classification and routing guardrails, not as the full multi-device containment system intended for later phases. A Phase 1 Compartment can mark content as local-only, disallow cloud LLM routing, disallow external export, declare allowed integrations, and declare allowed Devices within the limits of the single local Device model.

The hard Phase 1 invariants are narrow: `no_cloud_llm` Compartment content must not be sent to cloud LLM routes; `no_external_export` Compartment content must not be exported, projected, or handed to workers except as redacted structural references; Compartment-marked content crosses boundaries only through an allowed route and user-visible action; and boundary-crossing attempts that reach UbU are recorded in Logs as allowed or denied. Sensitive Compartment content is referenced rather than embedded in ordinary WorkItem structure.

Phase 1 does not promise complete privacy isolation, cryptographic isolation, hardware attestation, secure multi-device partial replication, protection from a malicious local administrator, or automated retention deletion/redaction. Retention policies may be recorded, but enforcement beyond append-only Log retention is post-MVP unless a specific implementation later adds and discloses it.

Un-compartmented content is explicitly labeled `security_level: low`. Low-security content is not compartment-protected and may be routed to configured integrations or cloud LLM-backed Automation Workers only through a user-visible integration or worker action.

Phase 1 may claim local-first operation only in the limited sense that canonical planning state, Logs, and source-linked project model data live in the local single-user UbU instance by default. It must not claim local-only operation, Phase 2 sync, conflict handling, partial replication, or secure multi-device Compartment propagation. Phase 1 may claim cloud LLM usage is optional, explicit, integration-scoped, and advisory; cloud LLMs are not the canonical planner and must not receive `no_cloud_llm` Compartment content.

**Consequences:**

- Public messaging must distinguish privacy-first architecture from the narrower implemented Phase 1 privacy baseline.
- Full Compartment enforcement across sync, retention, device eligibility, and cryptographic isolation remains future work unless separately accepted and implemented.
- Implementations must label un-compartmented content as low-security rather than implying default protection.

## UBU-D0162: ContextBundles govern long-context exposure

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0083`.

A `ContextBundle` is the governed package of context assembled for a model, tool, worker, agent, or long-context review. It is not a transient prompt string or implementation detail. It is the auditable boundary between UbU's explicit state and an execution backend.

The minimum `ContextBundle` records `context_bundle_id`, `schema_version`, purpose, requested operation, actor Identity, related Task/Objective/workflow refs, route request and decision refs when used for LLM routing, destination provider/tool/worker/model refs, provider class and boundary classification, source refs, source selectors or ranges, source snapshot refs or hashes, Compartment refs, Compartment policy results, Identity refs exposed, Association refs exposed, Relationship refs exposed when applicable, data categories exposed, sensitivity summary, token or size estimate, redaction policy, minimization rules applied, excluded-source summary, prompt-injection exposure summary when untrusted external text is included, retention policy, training or secondary-use policy, user-visible summary, approval state, approval Log ref when applicable, creation and expiry times, invocation refs, downstream candidate refs, exposure summary ref, and Log refs.

Raw payload is allowed only when required by the task and allowed by policy. The preferred representation is references, selectors, summaries, hashes, redacted excerpts, and structural fields. Repository-scale, chat-archive-scale, or organizational-introspection bundles must record the selected paths, objects, time ranges, messages, or evidence selectors and also summarize excluded material. A broad archive name without selectors is not enough provenance for review.

Compartment policy is checked before context assembly and again before invocation. If any source is denied for the destination, UbU must either exclude that source and record the exclusion or deny the bundle. Mixed-Compartment bundles inherit the most restrictive applicable route. User approval, provider settings, workflow rules, and capability grants cannot override `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, `local_only`, or other hard Compartment denials.

User approval is required before routing a ContextBundle when protected payload, low-security un-compartmented content beyond structural references, Relationship evidence, Association evidence, private messages, broad repository or archive content, or other long-context bulk material leaves the local boundary, crosses to a cloud provider, external provider, remote worker, managed gateway, third-party tool, or crosses a materially different Identity or Association disclosure boundary. Approval is also required when provider, model, operator, region, retention/training profile, data category, minimization policy, source scope, or destination changes materially from an already approved workflow template.

Policy-based approval is allowed only for prior user-approved rules that name the workflow, destination class, allowed Compartments or data categories, maximum source scope, minimization rule, retention profile, cost limits when relevant, expiry, and review requirement. Such rules must fail closed on hard Compartment denials or materially broader context than the rule allowed. Local-only deterministic processing or local model use may proceed without per-run approval when local policy permits it and no new disclosure boundary is crossed.

After invocation, UbU records a context exposure summary as a review artifact. The summary includes actual provider/model/tool, invocation refs, source counts and categories, Compartments, Identities, Associations, and Relationships exposed, raw-versus-summary/reference volume, redactions and exclusions, retention/training profile, prompt-injection exposure notes, approval and routing Log refs, downstream candidate refs, and denied or omitted context that may affect output quality. Exposure summaries must not contain secrets or unnecessary raw payload.

ContextBundles are immutable after use. Corrections, narrower reruns, broader reruns, or provider changes create a new bundle or superseding revision linked by Logs. Candidate updates, AssociationAttestations, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, worker mutation requests, and other downstream outputs must carry originating ContextBundle refs or equivalent provenance. Approval, denial, invocation, output admission, and output rejection Logs link back to the relevant ContextBundle.

**Consequences:**

- Long-context model use can proceed only through explicit minimization, approval, routing, exposure-summary, and provenance records.
- Organizational introspection and repository/chat archive review can use large models without treating large context windows as permission to send everything.
- `UBU-Q0092` can refine typed Relationship evidence policies while relying on the ContextBundle boundary for model routing.
- `UBU-Q0100` can distinguish ContextBundle Compartment/export denials as hard structural boundaries rather than advisory safeguards.

#### DESIGN.md §2.10.2 — Autonomy-first safeguards

```markdown
### 2.10.2 Autonomy-first safeguards

Relationship, extrospection, and RelationshipScopeTransition safeguards should be wise default-on recommendations, not paternalistic hard gates. UbU may strongly recommend pre-action introspection, extrospection, TrustCalibrationAssessment, power/vulnerability review, pacing review, graceful nonachievement planning, and manipulation-risk review. The user may bypass or disable advisory safeguards unless doing so violates a structurally enforceable hard boundary, a self-imposed user-configured required gate, or an unavoidable external provider/platform/legal constraint.

UbU classifies safeguards into four governance categories:

- **Product hard boundaries**: structural invariants UbU can enforce by data model, routing, authorization, validation, storage, provenance, or append-only audit mechanics. These include Compartment denials, privacy/export policy, data-access authorization, EvidenceUsePolicy restrictions, identity and Compartment isolation, integration authorization, provenance integrity, audit-record integrity, and immutable Log/correction rules.
- **External hard constraints**: provider, platform, app-store, integration, or legal constraints that UbU must obey for a specific jurisdiction, distribution channel, or external surface. They are source-labeled constraints, not independent expressions of UbU philosophy.
- **User-configured required gates**: self-imposed user or project policy gates that may block a workflow while enabled. They are recorded separately from product invariants and external constraints so documentation does not imply that UbU itself treats the underlying behavioral judgment as mechanically certain.
- **Advisory behavioral safeguards**: fallible risk assessments such as manipulation, coercion, harassment, stalking, deception, power-asymmetry risk, rumination risk, relationship-transition ethics, or other behavioral misuse checks. These are generally default-on, uncertainty-transparent, user-overrideable, and introspection-relevant when bypassed.

Hard-boundary documentation must name the specific enforced invariant and its enforcement mechanism. Behavioral-safeguard documentation should use language such as recommend, warn, ask for review, require user-configured review, or refuse a provider-forbidden action. It must not imply that UbU can reliably prevent behavioral misuse, illegal conduct, or harm merely by classifying user intent.
```

#### DESIGN.md §2.11 — Cloud LLM provider boundary

```markdown
### 2.11 Cloud LLM provider boundary

Cloud LLMs are optional execution providers, not the canonical UbU brain.

The core model should support provider-neutral routing across local model providers, user-configured BYOK cloud APIs, user-owned remote workers, optional UbUCorp managed gateways, and future compatible providers. External/cloud routing must remain governed by Compartment policy, context minimization, redaction where appropriate, cost policy, provenance, and user-visible disclosure.

Local-first operation remains the philosophical baseline. Cloud LLM use may improve performance and scalability, but it must not become a hidden dependency of the FOSS core or a way to bypass `no_cloud_llm` Compartments.

The minimum provider-neutral model is an `LLMProviderDescriptor` plus a routed invocation envelope. Provider descriptors identify `provider_id`, `provider_class`, `endpoint_or_worker_ref`, execution location, operator, region or jurisdiction when known, supported models, modalities, context window, structured-output and tool-use capabilities, safety behavior, retention/training/disclosure profile, cost and rate-limit metadata, credential reference kind, default-enabled state, and user-visible name. Provider classes are `local_process`, `byok_cloud_api`, `user_owned_worker`, `ubucorp_managed_gateway`, and `third_party_compatible`.

Provider adapters should expose the same narrow interface regardless of backend: list available models and capabilities, estimate cost and context fit, prepare a minimized request, invoke or stream completion, cancel when supported, and return usage, model, provider, and provenance metadata. The adapter interface normalizes execution; it does not erase trust-boundary differences.

An `LLMRouteRequest` records purpose, actor Identity, related Task/Objective/workflow refs, required capabilities, candidate provider policy, cost and latency limits, ContextBundle or source refs, required output schema when any, review requirement, and requested advisory use. An `LLMRouteDecision` records the selected provider and model, local/internal/external/cloud boundary classification, Compartment policy result, redaction and minimization summary, estimated cost, user-disclosure text, approval state, and Log refs for allowed or denied routing.

Compartment policy is evaluated before context assembly and again before provider invocation. Content from a `no_cloud_llm` Compartment cannot be sent to cloud provider classes, including BYOK cloud APIs, UbUCorp managed gateways, or third-party compatible cloud providers. Content from a `no_external_export` Compartment cannot be sent to external providers, remote workers, managed gateways, or third-party services except as redacted structural references that expose no protected payload. `local_only` content is limited to eligible local Devices and local providers. A capability grant, provider setting, or user approval cannot override these hard Compartment denials.

Cloud routing requires a minimized `ContextBundle` or equivalent envelope that records purpose, source object refs, Compartment refs, Identity and Association refs exposed, destination provider, model ref, data categories exposed, redaction policy, minimization notes, retention policy, user-visible summary, creation time, expiry when applicable, and downstream candidate refs. Raw payloads should be replaced with references, summaries, hashes, or redacted structural fields whenever the task can still be performed.

BYOK credentials are stored as scoped credential references, not embedded in provider descriptors, ContextBundles, prompts, Logs, or exported artifacts. A credential may be scoped by provider, account, model family, Identity, Compartment, workflow, cost budget, and Device or worker. The default storage target is the local instance or OS/device secret store; a user-owned worker may hold its own credential if explicitly configured. Credential rotation and revocation preserve audit continuity through credential version refs without exposing the secret.

UbUCorp managed inference is represented as one provider class, not as privileged protocol authority. It must use the same provider descriptor, routing envelope, Compartment gates, disclosure, cost controls, provenance, and output admission path as any other cloud provider. The FOSS core must remain useful when the UbUCorp provider is absent.

Before or at execution time, any workflow that uses a cloud or external LLM must disclose the provider, model or model class, operator, local-vs-cloud status, destination region when known, whether BYOK or UbUCorp-managed credentials are used, data categories and Compartments exposed, retention/training profile, estimated cost when available, and the fact that output is advisory until admitted through UbU validation and review. Users may grant per-run, session, workflow, or policy-based approval only when Compartment policy allows it.

#### DESIGN.md §21.3 — ContextBundle

```markdown
### 21.3 ContextBundle

A `ContextBundle` is a governed package of context assembled for a model, tool, worker, agent, or long-context review. It is the auditable boundary between UbU's explicit state and an execution backend.

Minimum fields:

- `context_bundle_id`;
- `schema_version`;
- `purpose`;
- `requested_operation`;
- `actor_identity_ref`;
- `related_task_refs`, `related_objective_refs`, or workflow refs when applicable;
- `route_request_ref` and `route_decision_ref` when the bundle is used for LLM routing;
- `destination_ref`, including provider/tool/worker, provider class, model or tool ref, and boundary classification;
- `source_refs`;
- `source_selectors`, time ranges, object ranges, or repository paths included;
- `source_snapshot_refs` or hashes sufficient to identify the assembled version;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `compartment_policy_results`;
- `identity_refs_exposed`;
- `association_refs_exposed`;
- `relationship_refs_exposed` when applicable;
- `data_categories_exposed`;
- `sensitivity_summary`;
- `token_or_size_estimate`;
- `redaction_policy`;
- `minimization_rules_applied`;
- `excluded_source_summary`;
- `prompt_injection_exposure_summary` when the bundle includes untrusted external text, webpages, messages, documents, or repository content;
- `retention_policy`;
- `training_or_secondary_use_policy`;
- `user_visible_summary`;
- `approval_state`;
- `approval_log_ref` when approval or denial was recorded;
- `created_at`;
- `expires_at`;
- `invocation_refs`;
- `supports_candidate_refs`;
- `exposure_summary_ref`;
- `log_refs`.

ContextBundles may contain raw payload only when the task requires it and policy allows it. The preferred representation is references, selectors, summaries, hashes, redacted excerpts, or structural fields that let the model perform the requested work without copying unnecessary private material. Repository and archive-scale bundles should record path or object selectors and excluded material, not merely a broad repository or archive name.

Compartment policy is checked before assembly and again before invocation. If any included source is denied for the destination, UbU must either exclude that source and record the exclusion or deny the bundle. A mixed-Compartment bundle inherits the most restrictive applicable route. User approval, capability grants, workflow settings, and provider preferences cannot override `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, `local_only`, or other hard Compartment denials.

User approval is required before routing a ContextBundle when the bundle sends protected payload, low-security un-compartmented content beyond structural references, Relationship evidence, Association evidence, private messages, broad repository or archive content, or other long-context bulk material to a cloud provider, external provider, remote worker, managed gateway, third-party tool, or different Identity/Association boundary. Approval is also required when the provider, model, operator, region, retention/training profile, data categories, minimization policy, or source scope differs materially from an already approved workflow template.

Policy-based approval is allowed only when a prior user-approved rule names the workflow, destination class, allowed Compartments or data categories, maximum source scope, minimization rule, retention profile, cost limits when relevant, expiry, and review requirement. The rule must still fail closed on hard Compartment denials or materially broader context than the rule allowed. Local-only deterministic processing or local model use may proceed without per-run approval when existing local policy permits it and the bundle does not cross a new disclosure boundary.

After invocation, UbU should create or update a context exposure summary. The summary records the actual provider/model/tool used, invocation refs, source counts and categories, Compartments, Identities, Associations, and Relationships exposed, raw-versus-summary/reference volume, redactions and exclusions, retention/training profile, prompt-injection exposure notes, approval and routing Log refs, downstream candidate refs, and any denied or omitted context that affected output quality. The summary is a review artifact and must not contain secrets or unnecessary raw payload.

ContextBundles are immutable after use. Corrections, narrower reruns, broader reruns, or provider changes create a new bundle or a superseding revision linked by Log entries. Candidate updates, AssociationAttestations, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, worker mutation requests, and other downstream outputs must carry `originating_context_bundle_refs` or equivalent provenance. Logs for approval, denial, invocation, output admission, and rejection should link back to the relevant ContextBundle.

#### DESIGN.md §22.4 — Advisory safeguards and hard boundaries

```markdown
### 22.4 Advisory safeguards and hard boundaries

Relationship-transition review gates are default-on advisory safeguards unless the user has configured them as self-imposed required gates or an external constraint makes them unavoidable. UbU should recommend pre-action introspection, extrospection, TrustCalibrationAssessment, power/vulnerability review, pacing review, graceful nonachievement planning, and manipulation-risk review where relevant. The user may bypass or disable such safeguards. Bypass decisions are introspection-relevant evidence and may surface as candidate findings about conflicts between revealed behavior and declared values.

Hard boundaries are narrower. They cover structurally enforceable product invariants and explicit policies: Compartment boundaries, privacy policy, data-access authorization, EvidenceUsePolicy restrictions, export prohibitions, identity/Compartment isolation, provenance integrity, audit-record integrity, integration authorization, and unavoidable provider/platform/legal constraints. Provider, platform, app-store, integration, and legal constraints should be recorded as external constraints with source, scope, affected workflow, and enforcement path when known.

Behavioral-risk checks such as manipulation, coercion, harassment, stalking, deception, power-asymmetry risk, rumination risk, or relationship-transition ethics are fallible classifier judgments. Treating them as hard gates would risk false positives that override legitimate user autonomy, false negatives that create misplaced trust, and a false impression that UbU can reliably prevent misuse or illegal behavior. They should generally be default-on, uncertainty-aware, user-overrideable advisory checks with introspection consequences when bypassed.

A user-configured required gate for a RelationshipScopeTransition is not reclassified as a product hard boundary. It is a self-imposed policy gate that may block the current workflow while enabled and should record the configuring Identity, scope, review requirement, bypass or disablement authority, and relevant Log refs.

Relationship documentation must not claim that UbU prevents coercion, harassment, stalking, manipulation, or illegal behavior. It may claim that UbU preserves structural privacy and authorization boundaries, surfaces advisory behavioral-risk findings, records bypasses as introspection-relevant evidence, and refuses actions only when a product hard boundary, user-required gate, or external constraint applies.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

**Access within ordinary life logistics (`UBU-D0338`).** Present guided camera acquisition and voice/text/form choices as ordinary ways to capture concerns, review proposals and act on Plans. Keep UbU's primary identity as a privacy-first life-logistics system; access features are available without a disability label or special onboarding category. Describe concrete benefits and limitations for tested workflows and Device/assistive-technology combinations. Camera availability alone establishes no accessibility claim.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

**Advisory generation policy (`UBU-D0341`).** For the MVP/Phase 2 advisory boundary, the operator configures sampling behavior in the selected inference runtime. UbU adds no generic decode Settings or application-selected temperature, top-p/top-k or repetition penalties, hidden request overrides or automatic retry tuning. Existing model/endpoint selection, timeout and review seed/ceiling behavior remain; the review seed provides no cross-model or cross-runtime reproducibility guarantee.

UbU owns bounded validator-safe producer grammars (`UBU-D0302`), finite request/output and job budgets, cancellation, validation and ordinary candidate review/admission. Required grammar and resource/output-limit fields may be sent to the runtime without transferring these contracts to sampler policy. A runtime unable to meet them leaves the affected operation unavailable with an explicit limitation and eligible retry/manual route. Abort, timeout and invalid output preserve saved state and admit no generated state changes. Retries retain current authority/input bindings and finite call/time budgets; failure cannot relax validation or authorize another route.

Document each supported adapter's required grammar/limit behavior and runtime sampling configuration instructions. Pin observable sampling configuration or its digest in qualified Device/backend profiles and label unknown effective defaults explicitly. Configuration changes require affected qualification checks under `UBU-D0331`/`UBU-D0336` where applicable. Before claiming conformance, require adapter fixtures that inspect requests for absence of application-selected sampler overrides while preserving existing review seed/ceiling behavior and required grammar/limit fields; exercise abort, timeout and invalid-output paths for preserved saved state, bounded retries and unchanged review/admission requirements. These are required checks, not passing runtime evidence or a diagnosis of the Vocabulary abort.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

For Phase 2, a single-live-session sync implementation is sufficient (`UBU-D0312`), with arbitrary N Devices, concurrent offline mutations, partial replicas, and transport-independent integrity-protected statements. Direct exchanges, imported bundles, and user-selected encrypted stores share the same causality, policy, and conflict rules; no Device or transport becomes a permanent canonical authority. Full automatic peer mesh is optional. DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §26's topology research remains a freeze gate, with at least three Devices demonstrating serialized direct exchange and encrypted store-and-forward, recoverable delivery, deterministic admission/conflict handling, and Compartment-safe partial replication as specified by `UBU-D0312`.

The minimum indirect path for the first Phase 2 sync release is implemented, authenticated encrypted bundle export/import through a user-selected file store, with at least one documented external rclone or rsync copy workflow exercised before freeze (`UBU-D0313`). Manual export/copy/import is sufficient; built-in clients and background delivery are optional. Encryption and recipient authorization protect statements, payloads, and manifests before storage, while ordinary admission and Compartment policy govern every import.

**Interrupted sync recovery (`UBU-D0314`).** Maintain a durable, policy-protected recovery record throughout each exchange. Connection loss, interrupted import, or restart without an admitted final checkpoint for the declared exchange scope records `incomplete_sync_session`. End the failed live session and release its slot while preserving recovery records and queued work; other Devices may synchronize and ordinary policy-authorized offline work may continue against an explicitly stale local view.

Fully verified, authorized statements whose required causal/admission dependencies are satisfied may be admitted incrementally. Persist each admission outcome, resulting state, and deduplication metadata as one crash-consistent unit. These admissions survive disconnect, retry, and discard, subject to existing redaction/purge policy. Partial statements, unverified payloads, and items with missing required statements or dependencies remain staged; they cannot be treated as admitted mutations or supply authoritative inputs to Plans or external projections.

An integrity-protected `checkpoint` or equivalent authenticated manifest commit must bind the declared exchange scope and expected statement/payload inventory, or its content-addressed equivalent. Admit it only after all material required for this Replica's authorized replication level has been durably verified and the required dependency/admission checks have completed. Report completion only after that checkpoint admission is durable, and only for that local scope. A checkpoint cannot admit contested mutations or prove other Devices current. A lost acknowledgment leaves delivery unknown to the sender; replay cannot undo the recipient's durable admissions. Outgoing statements remain pending for an intended recipient until the sender durably records a matching authenticated acknowledgment of that recipient's durable checkpoint admission. Exchange acknowledgments directly or through encrypted return bundles; transmission, file-copy success, or local checkpoint creation is insufficient.

The recovery record tracks exchange/bundle identity, source/recipient Device references, authenticated manifest reference if available, last locally admitted checkpoint, received/missing content references, and durable per-statement admission/idempotency outcomes. Reconstruct progress after restart from durable records. Recovery storage, dependency fetches, retention, and diagnostics obey current Zone/Compartment policy; restricted views reveal neither denied payload nor Compartment identity. Retention cleanup preserves permitted causality, deduplication, and incomplete/discard outcome metadata; missing content must be retransmitted rather than assumed received.

At the next authorized connection or import, resume from durable progress, or replay the original statements if no usable cursor exists. Preserve original statement ids, content hashes, idempotency keys, causal parents, and observed versions. Recheck integrity, Device trust, actor authority, current routing/Compartment policy, object/policy versions, and dependencies before admitting pending material or disclosing retained content. Recovery records and old checkpoints grant no authority. Automatic recovery is allowed only for deterministic, idempotent, non-authority-changing cases under `UBU-D0248`; revoked Devices and review-required conflicts retain their ordinary rejection/review rules.

Offer Resume/retry and Discard through the existing policy-safe incomplete/stale-sync diagnostic, showing the last completed scope and permitted pending counts. Discard removes unfinished incoming staging and its cursor while preserving already-admitted history, locally authored queued work, and still-required policy-permitted causality/idempotency metadata; record the discard outcome. It does not emit a tombstone or undo admitted mutations. A transient interruption alone requires no blocking merge prompt. Review-required conflicts use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §17's blocking `manual_decision` diagnostic and admitted `conflict_resolution` statement. Apply DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §22's Plan invalidation/recalculation rules to admitted changes even while the exchange remains incomplete.

**Sync-state warnings (`UBU-D0315`).** Multiple Devices may remain powered on and perform policy-authorized offline work simultaneously; only live sync exchanges serialize under `UBU-D0312`. Explain this once in Phase 2 onboarding. Ordinary offline use, Device switching, peer absence, and elapsed time alone cause no modal warning or recurring notification. Time-based reminders are opt-in with a user-selected cadence.

Keep one compact, non-blocking status for the active permitted sync scope, with details on demand: last durably admitted checkpoint and its scope/time (or "No completed exchange yet"), permitted locally authored pending counts split into awaiting exchange and awaiting recipient acknowledgment, staged incoming work, and incomplete-session state with Resume/retry and Discard per `UBU-D0314`. Say "Delivery unconfirmed" for a missing acknowledgment. File-copy success and a completed local exchange never justify "All Devices are up to date". A disconnected peer's changes are unknown unless policy-permitted evidence establishes pending state; age alone proves neither new changes nor their absence.

Show an inline Plan/Calendar freshness explanation where relevant inputs may be missing or stale: "This Plan uses this Device's current view; other Devices may have changes." Identify confirmed remote pending changes only when supported by permitted evidence. Locally authored outgoing work is saved local state, not evidence that the local Plan is stale. Label protected blocks and policy-withheld items separately from exchange failures; retrying sync cannot expand visibility.

Before external projection whose relevant permitted inputs have known pending changes, an incomplete exchange, or unknown peer freshness, present an inline review: "Other Device changes may be missing. Synchronize before projection, or use this Device's current view." Offer Sync/exchange (including export/import), Continue with current view, and Cancel. Continue requires explicit stale-state acceptance once per projection operation or reviewed batch, bound to the Device, operation, payload/input and policy versions, and permitted scope. Record it under §17.0 using `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind: safeguard_advisory_bypassed`; recheck the bindings before execution. This accepts freshness uncertainty only. Current authority, Device trust, integrity, Compartment/export policy, Plan-legitimacy requirements, and `UBU-D0248`'s blocking `manual_decision`/`conflict_resolution` rules still govern eligibility. If those rules forbid execution, omit Continue. Mere interruption or missing peer contact creates no blocking merge prompt.

Coalesce advisory explanations by Device, permitted scope, condition, and material evidence. Offer Dismiss until material change or Snooze until a user-selected time; persist the local choice across views and restart while keeping status discoverable. Reopen for material changes affecting that warning, such as newly learned permitted pending statements or changed relevant Plan/input versions; snooze may also reopen at its chosen deadline. A new projection operation needs its own scoped choice. Age or restart alone cannot reopen a dismissed advisory; opt-in reminders may follow their chosen cadence. Dismissal needs no justification and is logged under §17.0 without turning the warning into a synchronized Task. Advisory suppression cannot hide a required blocking conflict diagnostic.

Generate visible text, counts, urgency, and reappearance only from evidence or derived warnings allowed at this Replica's replication level. Restricted notices use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §23's "A protected object cannot sync to this Device." without denied payload, source object identifiers, or Compartment ids/labels; omit object-specific notices when even existence is denied. Warnings preserve intentional partial replication and never recommend powering off other Devices or switching to a single primary Device.

**Future schedulable manual review (`UBU-D0316`).** A later versioned extension may admit a shared Dynamic review Task with independent, coherent scheduling inputs and a protected conflict-episode identity. Its target is evidence to review, not admitted contested effects. Place it only in validated unaffected Calendar capacity; otherwise keep it unplaced. The diagnostic/prompt must still admit a permitted source-conflict `conflict_resolution` without review Task creation, placement, or completion. Conflicts in the Task, its scheduling/projection artifacts, or resolution workflow terminate at that diagnostic and never spawn review-of-review Tasks. Task lifecycle reconciliation follows resolution; snooze or deletion cannot clear the underlying blocker. Current authority and source privacy govern every step. The first Phase 2 sync release retains §17's diagnostic-only model until this extension's versioned contracts and behavioral gates pass.

**Task lore after Clarify (`UBU-D0317`).** After a Clarify round, persist the operator's submitted answers through ordinary admission independently of synthesis, then offer one additional local synthesis job. The Task description is readable narrative. Keep the pre-existing description, subsequent operator edits, exact questions/answers and their necessary context as separate durable per-Task source records with stable ids, versions, actor/Device/session/round provenance, effective/recorded times, hashes and privacy/retention policy. Versioned context refs are sufficient only while the referenced context remains retrievable. Corrections append records with explicit supersession links; they never edit originals. Accepted model prose is a derived revision, not independent evidence. Raw audio/video retention is not required.

The local model returns an `AdvisoryCandidate` containing proposed prose, model/template provenance, the complete source manifest/digest and a source-to-prose coverage map. Every answer, qualification, original lore statement, correction and unresolved issue must map to prose spans; every factual prose assertion must map back to sources. Equivalent repetitions may share wording. Superseded assertions retain a temporal account of the old and corrected meanings; disagreements, unknowns, declined answers and open questions remain explicit. Preserve attribution, negation, conditions, quantities and uncertainty. Unsupported inferences remain separate labelled suggestions, not synthesized lore.

Review shows the description diff and a source-by-source checklist with exact source text beside its mapped prose. Deterministic checks require complete source/span coverage, valid references, finite bounds and current bindings; structural coverage and another model's opinion cannot establish semantic fidelity. Explicit operator approval confirms readable prose preserves all source meanings and invents no facts or agreement. Offer edit, regenerate or keep the prior description; edited prose needs renewed coverage review. Recheck authority, policy, Task-description/source/candidate versions and source digest before atomically admitting the description revision and its provenance. Concurrent changes invalidate approval and use ordinary conflict review. Failure, rejection or model unavailability preserves the prior description and saved answers. Lore approval does not admit typed planner constraints or authorize external action.

Later Clarify uses admitted prose plus the source manifest, unresolved issues and correction links. Supply exact question/context/answer records for topics being revisited and make remaining permitted originals retrievable. Check the originals before treating a topic as settled; absence from a prompt is not absence of knowledge. Missing records make context explicitly incomplete. A partial Replica unable to establish the full source frontier may offer a scoped preview but cannot replace the Task description.

Declare finite storage, prompt, result and job time/call limits. Retain source history and admitted revision/provenance while the Task is retained; archival must remain queryable. Chunk long inputs along complete source records and track coverage across chunks through the final prose. If complete reviewable prose cannot fit, stop and keep saved sources rather than truncate or drop knowledge; no cloud fallback. At storage exhaustion, pause Clarify and show any unsaved input; never claim it saved or silently evict history. Rejected candidate payloads follow the ordinary minimized retention lifecycle.

Source records, synthesized prose, coverage maps and subsequent context inherit all source disclosure, routing and retention restrictions; local processing does not waive them. Reject synthesis into a Task whose destination policy cannot protect its sources. Recheck policy on every read, sync and export. Authorized redaction/purge also removes disallowed content from dependent prose, revisions and cached context; prevent reconstruction from retained derivatives. Keep only permitted minimized gap metadata, disclose incompleteness without revealing denied existence, and never claim lossless retention beyond that scope.

**Recurring-busy workaround retirement (`UBU-D0318`).** Timed expanded recurrence instances already capture as individual Tasks. Retire a temporary manual capacity blocker only for an operator-reviewed source/series and planning scope with verified replacement occupancy. Full series-level import is not a prerequisite when expanded instances cover that scope; unsupported inputs, missed/on-demand capture and incomplete coverage retain explicit residual blocking.

Record a policy-permitted coverage manifest binding the implementation revision, source/series references, capture window/cursor and completeness evidence, source and admitted input versions, planning horizon, expected busy UTC intervals, occurrence-to-Task lineage, and blocker references. Every relevant busy occurrence must map to one active capacity-bearing representation; record how any uncovered part of the blocker remains protected. Titles or coincident times do not establish occurrence identity. Repeated capture, restart and replay preserve lineage without duplicate Tasks. Moves, cancellations and series changes supersede prior active reservations through ordinary admission while preserving logged history; absence from an incomplete response cannot establish cancellation.

Fixed busy commitments use capacity-occupying Static Tasks at validated UTC start/end times and bound chunks under `UBU-D0279`. Capture counts, Calendar display and Task existence alone do not prove occupancy. Verify the CPU reference path and each enabled planner backend against expected occupied/free intervals: flexible placements cannot enter busy time, and a source occurrence, its projection and its temporary blocker cannot consume capacity twice. Distinct commitments that genuinely overlap retain their conflict rather than being deduplicated by time.

Before removal, show the exact blocker replacements and residual intervals and obtain explicit operator approval bound to the manifest and current versions. Apply them through ordinary admission as one batch, or an equivalent serialized handoff that prevents Plan certification/projection of intermediate missing or doubled occupancy. Invalidate affected Plans and certify recalculation before reuse or projection. Failure or stale inputs preserve protection and require fresh review. Retire only the identified workaround, preserving source commitments and history. Advancing the horizon or receiving material source changes requires renewed coverage checks before using affected capacity; missing, stale or policy-withheld data never proves free time. Evidence and diagnostics obey current Compartment policy; this process neither grants capture/export authority nor bypasses existing sync/projection checks.

**Measured local multimodal hardware (`UBU-D0331`).** Qualify an exact physical-hardware/software profile, separately identifying every execution-enclave Device and its capture, review, inference and optional planning roles. Pin hardware/RAM, OS build and security-update posture, drivers/runtime, model and weights digest, quantization, context/media sizes, storage/key configuration, UbU/template and policy revisions. Declare enabled sources, latency classes, concurrency, supported session duration and operating conditions. Primary mobile interaction does not select a full mobile planner or compute API (`UBU-Q0160`); capture-mode/device allocation and delivery sequence remain `UBU-Q0183`.

Before testing, freeze the scenario set, useful-outcome rubric and finite acceptance limits for quality, latency/freshness, memory/storage, battery/thermal behavior and cancellation. Use §21.1.3's ordinary interaction and text/form workflows, with synthetic or expressly consented fixtures covering visible details, exact names/values, noisy speech, ambiguity, corrections and unsupported requests. Review grounding, preserved uncertainty, fabricated assertions, correction burden and useful candidate-to-admission/next-action outcomes; transcripts, token rates and plausible conversation alone cannot pass. Count accepted, corrected, unresolved, rejected and failed outcomes separately over all trials. Numeric interaction profiles follow §21.1.4 and remain `UBU-Q0168`'s measured work.

For each proposed Device/backend/mode, run at least 30 cold-start and 100 warm trials using the pinned fixtures, plus at least 30 minutes of its proposed concurrent capture/inference/UI workload and the full maximum supported session if longer. Measure the complete capture-to-review route, including any authorized worker transfer. Record ambient conditions, charging/battery state, competing load, instrumentation and repeat procedure. Report §21.1.4's separate timings with sample counts, median, p95, maximum and misses/errors; include peak aggregate CPU/accelerator memory, model loading, buffers/caches and concurrent manual/planning work at the declared state/context limits. Report model/state/approved-artifact storage, peak scratch and required free-space reserve, energy/battery measurements and uncertainty, temperature/throttling and performance over time. Unavailable metrics stay explicit; missing evidence for a required limit prevents qualification. A short successful run cannot establish sustained or longer-session support.

Endpoint qualification must demonstrate a maintained security-update posture, installation/model integrity checks, OS access isolation, protected Device keys and access-controlled encrypted persistent storage with documented key custody and recovery. State the threat envelope: locked-device loss, unauthorized unprivileged processes, unintended persistence and unauthorized egress; do not claim protection from a compromised OS or malicious local administrator. Exercise source/Device revocation, lock/restart, denied reads/egress, storage exhaustion and interrupted cleanup. Inventory raw/intermediate/retained copies, OS/runtime swap, hibernation, crash dumps, caches and backups; enforce §12.2 and §21.1.5 on every applicable path or disable the affected mode. Encryption alone cannot satisfy transient-media retention. A rooted/debug planning-parity device supplies no endpoint-security evidence by itself; hardware attestation remains optional under DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §26, and cleanup establishes no forensic-erasure guarantee.

Publish a policy-safe support matrix linking the exact profile, enabled workflows/classes, measured usable-memory/free-storage envelope, quality and timing results, sustained operating duration, security/retention outcomes and demonstrated fallback. Test offline/model loss, low battery, thermal/resource pressure, stop/silence, delayed results and manual completion without hidden cloud routing or loss of permitted saved state. A worker on another Device needs its own qualified endpoint/profile and existing route/Compartment checks; a same-Device worker remains an execution context unless separately admitted under §23.1. Ownership grants no disclosure authority. Only profiles passing all declared limits and mandatory security/retention gates may be operator-approved for those slices; material profile changes require affected rechecks. Label the selected configuration a tested sufficient profile among the tested candidates, with failures and limitations visible; infer no universal phone minimum or local-versus-cloud quality ranking. `UBU-Q0177` stays Open until a reviewed evidence-backed profile is selected; a protocol alone cannot close it. Lower-cost reach remains `UBU-Q0178`.

**Inference runtime reuse qualification (`UBU-D0336`).** Extend the endpoint gate to the deployed runtime's effective process permissions and source-dependent state across jobs. Inventory prompt/KV caches, embeddings, decoded media, buffers, leased handles and scratch separately from verified read-only model weights. A warm process or shared weights grant no access to prior job context. Enforce §21.1.5's lifecycle before reuse; separately authorized retained artifacts enter a new job only through fresh broker access and current bindings. If safe reuse cannot be demonstrated, qualify an isolated per-job runtime or leave the affected mode unavailable.

Run paired synthetic camera-and-voice jobs A/B under distinct grants, with B denied A's source and context. Put a unique synthetic detail in A and request it from B without supplying it. Exercise both job orders, ordinary completion, cancellation and source/policy revocation, crash/restart and resource pressure; include overlapping jobs only where concurrency is proposed. Inspect B's actual supplied context, runtime reads, result/artifact releases, cache/handle lookups and diagnostics for unauthorized A content or identifiers. Probe ambient filesystem, credential, camera/microphone and network access through the runtime's actual interfaces under deployment permissions; model refusal or a configured permission declaration alone cannot establish denial. Include an authorized control supplying the synthetic detail to B through the broker to verify the detector and permitted access path. Absence of a detail in generated prose alone cannot prove isolation.

Record pinned fixture/grant versions, expected and observed access/release outcomes, runtime permission observations, reset/termination behavior and policy-safe evidence links in the qualification report. Every enabled reuse/concurrency mode must demonstrate the allowed control and zero unauthorized reads/releases in these fixtures; unobserved mandatory paths remain unqualified. Repeat the cold/warm and sustained workload measurements with the enforced isolation, reset and cache restrictions active, accounting for their time, energy and aggregate memory/storage costs. Publish limitations beside the support matrix. These fixtures supply no passing runtime, hardware selection or forensic-erasure result.

**Economically accessible local paths (`UBU-D0332`).** Compare two candidate routes for a bounded camera-and-voice slice under `UBU-D0331`:

- **Existing single Device:** bounded still-image capture and push-to-talk audio, with smaller/quantized or task-specific local models capable of CPU inference, finite context and serialized inference jobs. Evaluate supported older hardware without assuming that age, nominal RAM or model size establishes eligibility.
- **Existing personal worker:** capture and review on one Device, with bounded inference on an existing operator-owned laptop/desktop worker. Qualify both endpoints and the complete authenticated encrypted transfer route. Current Device trust, Compartment/source permissions and original consent, freshness, retention and job limits govern every copy; ownership or physical proximity grants no authority. Worker loss leaves a qualified same-Device route or useful text/forms.

Each candidate uses legally locally runnable software/weights with disclosed licenses, installation downloads and fees, and requires no hosted inference, paid API credential or recurring model-service subscription. Dedicated accelerators and continuous streaming are optional for this evaluated slice; `UBU-Q0183` retains overall release scope and sequencing. Demonstrate same-Device operation with networking disabled and worker operation with Internet access blocked. Ordinary manual entry, exact correction, candidate review, admitted-state inspection and action recording remain available with models absent under §21.1.3.

Before dispatch, show the selected route, enabled modalities, measured latency class, finite wait/context/media limits and fallback. Reduce resolution, frame count or context only within a qualified profile, retaining transform provenance and explicit missing coverage. Slower processing cannot extend raw-media deadlines or freshness, silently omit necessary detail, or weaken uncertainty, corroboration, review, admission or Plan certification. Unsupported work returns an explicit limitation and an eligible retry or manual route. Switching models, endpoints or sources requires fresh bindings and applicable consent; cost/resource pressure grants no routing authority.

Extend `UBU-D0331`'s frozen useful-outcome rubric and real-device trials with a paired comparison of these routes on the same permitted §21.1.3 fixtures and declared workload. Include at least one CPU-only inference candidate and one existing-worker candidate; unavailable or ineligible candidates remain visible. Require a visible camera detail plus speech to produce a grounded reviewable candidate, exact correction/admission and a useful next action or explicit planning limitation. Report successful, corrected, unresolved, rejected and failed trials separately, plus total workflow time and operator setup, maintenance and correction effort. A text-only fallback cannot establish multimodal reach.

Declare the comparison baseline, usage period/workload and evaluated cash, effort, energy and storage budgets before trials. Report incremental outlay for already-owned hardware separately from acquisition/refurbishment and replacement assumptions. Include necessary software/model fees, download/connectivity, measured workload energy, storage, secure upkeep and accessories for the whole route, including a worker. Price observations state date, region and currency; running-cost estimates state usage period, workload, rates and uncertainty. Distinguish measured outcomes, quoted prices and estimates; unknown required costs prevent a claim that the budget is met. Use "lower-cost" only for a specified comparator and matched useful workload, with accuracy, latency and effort tradeoffs beside cash savings. User-supplied budget scenarios establish an evaluated envelope, without inferring individual affordability or population reach.

Publish costs, effort, qualified workflows/classes and failures alongside `UBU-D0331`'s support matrix. Select a path only after the operator reviews evidence that it passes the declared usefulness, resource, cost and mandatory security/retention limits. If no path qualifies, retain useful manual operation and the explicit multimodal gap. `UBU-Q0178` remains Open until an evidence-backed lower-cost path is selected; this protocol establishes no price, device minimum or supported configuration. `UBU-Q0177` and `UBU-Q0168` retain hardware and numeric-profile acceptance; CPU inference here selects no mobile planner or compute API under `UBU-Q0160`.

**Entry cash and useful-outcome accounting (`UBU-D0337`).** Extend `UBU-D0332`'s comparison with explicit ownership scenarios: capture/review Device only, or capture/review Device plus an existing worker. Include the Device-only scenario even if its worker route is unavailable. Evaluate acquisition/replacement separately; an already-owned worker's zero acquisition outlay cannot be used in a scenario that must buy one.

Before trials, declare finite entry-cash, cash-per-budget-period and total-horizon ceilings alongside the existing effort, energy and storage budgets. Entry cash includes every mandatory payment before the first useful multimodal outcome. Show subsequent payments in the period when due, including secure upkeep and necessary replacement under the declared assumptions. Amortization or unconfirmed resale proceeds cannot make a due payment fit. State the security-support and replacement assumptions over that horizon; continued use after an endpoint's declared maintained-security eligibility ends cannot be priced as a saving. Unknown required payments prevent a budget pass.

For each measured workload, report all-attempt totals for run-related cash, energy and active operator minutes, including failures and retries, and divide each total by the number of useful multimodal outcomes. That denominator includes only successful or successfully corrected camera-and-voice workflows meeting the frozen rubric; keep those outcome counts separate. Manual-only completion after multimodal failure remains fallback and cannot enter the denominator. With zero qualifying outcomes, report per-outcome values as undefined and the workload as unqualified. Period estimates retain the observed outcome mix and disclose uncertainty; fixed entry, upkeep and replacement costs remain in whole-route totals.

Add ownership prerequisites, entry/period payment schedules and ceilings, all-attempt totals, outcome denominators and per-outcome values to the cost/support matrix, with evidence links and pass/fail/unknown for each budget and mandatory gate. Select only for scenarios whose whole-route budgets and `UBU-D0331`/`UBU-D0336` qualification gates pass. Keep any no-worker multimodal gap visible. This extension selects no measured configuration or cost envelope; `UBU-Q0178` stays Open pending operator-reviewed results.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.
