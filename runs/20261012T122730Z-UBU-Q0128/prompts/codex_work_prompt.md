## UBU-Q0128: Embodied Audio Interaction

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 100 Depends on: None Blocks: Commute Mode, restricted-attention interaction, audio-only task capture, audio-safe messaging, media-state routing, exercise/rest/walking interaction modes Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-10-12 Scored from commit: None

Depends on unregistered areas: Affect model, Compartment policy, audio I/O policy,
MCP/tool harness policy, device context model.

### Question

UbU may support Embodied Audio Interaction: audio-first or audio-only interaction for situations where hands, visuals, or intellectual bandwidth are restricted, including driving, bicycling, walking, running, jogging, stationary exercise, physical resting, cooking, housework, and other embodied contexts. What is the interaction model, policy envelope, context-routing architecture, and safety boundary for using UbU as a harness over STT, TTS, MCP-scoped LLM calls, media apps, and structured UbU state during these restricted-attention contexts?

### Subquestions

1. What activity contexts should Embodied Audio Interaction explicitly model: driving, bicycling, walking, running, jogging, stationary exercise, resting, cooking, housework, showering, transit, or user-defined modes?
2. What input and output constraints should be represented for each mode: hands availability, visual availability, locomotion risk, interruptability, working-memory budget, intellectual bandwidth, emotional bandwidth, maximum prompt length, maximum response length, and maximum number of choices?
3. How should UbU distinguish interaction mode from Compartment: for example, `Compartment: UbU Project / Public Outreach` and `Mode: Driving`, rather than making driving itself a Compartment?
4. What deterministic policy layer should sit between audio input, MCP/tool access, LLM interpretation, UbU state, and external actions?
5. How should UbU package scoped context for an LLM during audio-only use so that the model receives enough context for high performance without overexposing private, irrelevant, or unsafe data?
6. What structured JSON contract should audio-interaction LLM calls return: intent, entities, confidence, ambiguity, cognitive-load estimate, action risk, proposed action, required confirmation, defer reason, and safe-for-mode flag?
7. What actions are safe in each embodied mode: idea capture, task creation, message drafting, calendar review, media control, lightweight reflection, exercise coaching, original narration, or external sends?
8. What actions should be prohibited or deferred in high-risk modes such as driving or bicycling: high-stakes messages, irreversible deletion, financial actions, legal commitments, major scheduling changes, multi-party communication, or visually dependent review?
9. How should UbU handle speech recognition uncertainty, road noise, breath noise, interruptions, partial utterances, ambiguous references, and false continuity?
10. What confirmation grammar should UbU require for external actions in restricted-attention contexts, especially where a generic “yes” is too ambiguous?
11. How should UbU use affect information to decide whether the user is ready for intellectual interaction, should only capture ideas, should defer complex work, or should receive non-intellectual audio instead?
12. How should UbU detect and model user understandability during embodied contexts, including reduced recall, reduced intelligence-in-the-moment, lower working memory, or increased interruption probability?
13. How should UbU support audio-safe messaging: relationship-aware drafting, concise readback, wrong-recipient prevention, tone checking, review queues, and defer-until-parked policies?
14. How should UbU integrate with media apps without replacing them: music playback, podcast resume state, audiobook state, skip/rewind, queue, save, summarize, and “what did I miss?” interactions?
15. How should UbU interpret vague audio commands such as “go back,” “pause that,” “save this,” “what was that?”, or “remind me about this” based on current activity, media state, recent interruptions, and project context?
16. Should UbU expose an `InteractionBudget` object, and if so, what fields should it include for input channels, output channels, visual attention, manual control, locomotion risk, intellectual bandwidth, emotional bandwidth, social risk tolerance, max turn length, action permissions, and deferral policy?
17. How should Embodied Audio Interaction interact with local-first architecture, cross-device sync, car audio systems, headphones, watches, phones, and future wearable devices?
18. What audit trail should UbU preserve for audio interactions, especially when external actions were proposed, confirmed, deferred, or rejected?
19. How should UbU avoid becoming an attention-extraction system or productivity grinder, and instead act as an attention steward that sometimes recommends silence, music, rest, or non-intellectual content?
20. Given the primary camera-and-voice MVP release commitment in `UBU-D0292`, which restricted-attention primitives must be delivered first, and which richer media/narration integrations remain later work? Phase 3 is no longer a gate on the primary surface.

### Current direction

**Architectural answer and MVP scope (`UBU-D0292`, `UBU-D0293`).** The primary surface is local camera-and-voice perception: observation → reviewable candidate state → resolution against permitted persistent context → consequential clarification → CPU semantic/policy/conflict validation → operator admission → planning from admitted state. Model-time evidence never substitutes for planner-time semantics. Voice is ordinary interaction; forms and text remain available for precision, context, preference and accessibility. Capture is mode-bound, visible, source-scoped and pausable; continuous AV requires the existing explicit mode, Compartment review, routing disclosure and user approval. Raw-media minimization/deletion is distinct from append-only correction and evidence metadata. Intent and affect remain user-declared. These answers refine the already-licensed mechanism, rather than making a model the planner.

**Restricted-attention default (`UBU-D0309`).** DESIGN.md §21.1.2 specifies a controller-owned `InteractionBudget`, activity/Compartment separation, candidate capture and scoped media transport, high-risk deferral, interruption invalidation and fresh review after mode/Device changes. Model confidence or spoken confirmation cannot expand these permissions. Quantitative mode profiles, external-action confirmation grammar, richer integrations and naming remain open.

**Initial typed interpretation (`UBU-D0310`).** DESIGN.md §21.1.2 defines `AudioInterpretationV1` for the existing capture/control envelope: closed action shapes, evidence/context aliases, advisory confidence/load/risk/confirmation fields, semantic consistency checks and controller-owned request bindings. Stale, malformed or duplicate model results cannot authorize speech or repeated media transport. This answers the initial-envelope portion of subquestion 6; richer interpretation shapes remain open.

**Serialized budget (`UBU-D0311`).** DESIGN.md §21.1.2 defines the closed controller-issued `InteractionBudgetV1`, including versioned context/authority bindings, declared-or-unknown readiness, channel/attention bounds, finite byte/time/choice caps and fixed review/deferral policies. Semantic checks, monotonic deadlines and turn-owned counters prevent stale snapshots or budget renewal from restoring authority. This answers the initial-envelope serialization portion of subquestions 2 and 16; numerical profile values and richer envelopes remain open.

**Naming (absorbs delta §17.2).** Embodied Audio Interaction remains the recorded name for the restricted-attention audio subset. No name for the broader camera-and-voice surface has been selected; neither working proposal is adopted. Should this wider interaction model receive a distinct canonical name, or should the existing label remain only the narrower mode? Keep this as an operator naming choice, not a new decision record.

Embodied Audio Interaction is the recorded name for the restricted-attention audio subset. It generalizes the earlier Commute Mode concept beyond driving to any situation where audio interaction is available while hands, visuals, attention, or intellectual bandwidth are constrained. Driving and bicycling are the most safety-critical cases, but walking, running, gym use, physical resting, cooking, housework, and similar contexts share the same architectural pattern. The broader primary camera-and-voice surface is MVP release scope; its naming remains open above.

UbU should not merely provide “ChatGPT in the car” or generic voice chat. UbU should remain the harness, context controller, policy layer, and action authority. STT, TTS, MCP, LLMs, media apps, and device integrations should be subordinate components. UbU should decide what context is exposed, what actions are allowed, how much complexity the user can handle, when confirmation is required, and when work should be deferred.

The feature should distinguish agency audio, media-control audio, and generative-experience audio. UbU may allow complex processes in restricted-attention contexts only by decomposing them into bounded, audio-safe primitives such as capture, triage, short drafting, readback, review-queue creation, and low-risk execution. UbU should be conservative with external messages, irreversible actions, financial/legal commitments, and any action requiring visual review.

Affect and readiness remain user-declared or unknown. UbU may use those declarations to offer silence, rest or user-selected media, without diagnosing reduced intelligence or treating available audio time as an obligation to work. Original Narration remains the separate question `UBU-Q0129`.

### Resolution

Architecture and MVP-release priority are answered by `UBU-D0292` and `UBU-D0293`; the former Phase 3 release gate is superseded. `UBU-D0309` answers the initial restricted-attention permission envelope, controller-owned budget, high-risk deferral and interruption/review boundary. `UBU-D0310` adds the exact initial-envelope LLM-output schema, semantic checks and request/freshness binding. `UBU-D0311` specifies the exact initial-envelope budget serialization, units, revision/freshness checks and turn-owned limits. This question remains Open for quantitative mode profiles, richer LLM-output extensions, detailed external-action confirmation grammar, richer messaging/media/coaching integrations, device-specific behavior and the naming choice. The capture delivery sequence is `UBU-Q0183`; related evidence, latency, retention and hardware questions remain `UBU-Q0164`–`UBU-Q0182`. No generic voice confirmation authorizes a consequential external action.

## Patch baseline

The patch must apply to the **current working-tree files** in the repository above.
The selected question and context excerpts come from that working tree, which may
include uncommitted ranking and metadata updates.

- Set the JSON `base_commit` field to `47c766e5ffea71c99f177a80f55df1488d026659` for provenance. It does not
  define the patch's file contents: do not use `git show HEAD:<path>` or the Git index
  as the original version when it differs from the working tree.
- Use exact working-tree lines for all removed and unchanged lines. Preserve existing
  metadata updates and exclude unrelated edits from the proposal.
- To generate the diff, compare unmodified working-tree copies with the proposed
  contents. Validate against the working tree with `git apply --check`; a successful
  `git apply --check --cached` checks the index and is insufficient.

## Canonical design context

The excerpts below are **not** the whole canonical files. They are the subset selected by
following references from the selected question: its dependencies, the decisions those
questions cite, and the sections those cite in turn.

Read them under these rules:

- **Absence is not non-existence.** Ids and sections you cannot see here still exist.
  Never conclude that a question is unasked, a decision unmade, or a section absent
  because it is not shown.
- **Do not renumber or reuse ids.** Allocate new entries from the next free ids below.
- **Patch context must match the real file.** Hunks are applied against the full files,
  not against these excerpts, and `git apply` locates them by surrounding context. Quote
  surrounding lines exactly as they appear here.
- **Scope your edits to what you can see.** Do not delete or rewrite text on the
  assumption that it duplicates something outside these excerpts.

Next free ids — use these for anything you add:

- next question id: `UBU-Q0191`
- next decision id: `UBU-D0322`

`DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` is read-only context and is not in the patch

### DECISIONS.md — cited decisions

#### UBU-D0292

```markdown
## UBU-D0292: Camera-and-voice perception is the primary MVP interaction surface

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.13, §4.2, §12.2, §21; MULTIMODAL_INTERACTION.md. Amends `UBU-D0132` and supersedes `UBU-Q0128`'s Phase 3 release gate.

Multimodal perception becomes the primary interaction surface without becoming an authoritative planner. The camera proposes candidate state; the kernel still plans; admission is still the operator's.

Local camera-and-voice interaction is part of the MVP release, rather than an optional post-MVP input feature. This extends release scope without retrospectively changing the frozen Phase 1 dogfooding implementation. The work belongs in the Phase 1b MVP-release backlog; `UBU-Q0183` asks for its exact delivery sequence, capture-mode coverage and relationship to the switch and device waves. A Phase 3 question cannot gate this release commitment. `UBU-Q0128` now carries Phase 1b and answers the architecture while retaining unresolved restricted-attention details and naming.

The camera is a perception layer: show the world, resolve candidate objects and facts against permitted persistent context, ask for consequential ambiguity, and admit only validated operator-approved updates. Voice is ordinary interaction; text and forms remain available for preference, accessibility, privacy, precision and context. Primary does not mean mandatory capture or always-on consent. Raw images in this primary path are processed on the operator's own hardware, without upload to a hosted model. Any later export is a separate policy-governed operator choice.

The observation/admission mechanism of `UBU-D0132` is preserved. Backend choice remains replaceable; neither confidence, conversational fluency nor observed elapsed time confers planning authority. Continuous AV refines the existing explicit-mode, Compartment-review, routing-disclosure and approval boundary in §12.2. `UBU-D0290` is unchanged: camera-first mobile interaction's roadmap implication is a question in `UBU-Q0160`, not an implied choice of mobile planner or compute API. Rich Resource/Skill/Technique examples retain their existing later-phase dependencies.

#### UBU-D0293

```markdown
## UBU-D0293: Perceptual evidence maps onto the existing provenance enum

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11.2, §21.1; MULTIMODAL_INTERACTION.md. Refines `UBU-D0132` as amended by `UBU-D0292`.

Keep the closed `ProvenanceKind` vocabulary `asserted / measured / derived / proposed`. The perceptual vocabulary describes evidence and review operations, not an ordered confidence ladder and not new enum variants. The mapping is explicit and conditional on how a value was established:

| Perceptual term | Existing kind and admission meaning |
|---|---|
| `observed` | An unconfirmed visual interpretation is a `proposed` candidate. An actual instrument reading can support `measured`; a person's report of what they saw is `asserted`. Observation alone does not admit state. |
| `inferred` | An unconfirmed perceptual value is `proposed`. `derived` is reserved for a computation from other facts, with its inputs and derivation evidenced; a model's guess is not such a computation. |
| `operator_confirmed` | An admitted personal assertion is `asserted`; an operator recording an instrument reading may choose `measured`. Confirmation does not automatically make an inference a measurement. |
| `externally_verified` | Verification is an evidence qualifier. An attested statement maps to `asserted`, an instrument reading to `measured`, or a computation from facts to `derived`, according to the underlying source. Verification alone neither selects a kind nor admits a value. |
| perceptual `measured` | Map to enum `measured` only for an instrument or reading. The proposed ladder's strongest-confidence meaning is not adopted. |

The enum member is `ProvenanceKind::Proposed`, stored on `FactProvenance.kind`; `FactProvenance` is a struct, not an enum. It remains unused by the current advisory value policy: existing advisors propose no fact values (`UBU-D0296`). A future unconfirmed perceptual value is the first legitimate prospective use of that member. Such a value stays in candidate state; it is not a write into canonical UniverseState. This records a future mapping, not an implemented perception producer or permission for existing advisors to propose values.

Keep confidence, observation source, corroboration and verification qualifiers in existing candidate/evidence records, including `DiscoveryEvidenceItem`, and link admission to that evidence. Do not add fields to `FactProvenance`, whose current shape is only `kind` and `recorded_at`. Exact evidence sufficiency and admission profiles remain questions (`UBU-Q0165`, `UBU-Q0166`, `UBU-Q0167`, `UBU-Q0172`). No enum, schema, pin or migration changes here; `UBU-D0291`'s vocabulary governance is preserved.

#### UBU-D0309

```markdown
## UBU-D0309: Restricted-attention audio starts with a controller-enforced capture envelope

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.1.2. Partially answers `UBU-Q0128`; refines `UBU-D0292` without changing its MVP-release commitment or `UBU-D0293`'s provenance mapping.

Keep activity mode separate from Compartment and realtime source/routing mode. A session-local `InteractionBudget` bounds channels, attention, turn complexity, operation classes and deferral; UbU computes permissions from current policy and grants, rather than accepting a model's safety or confidence judgment. Intent, capacity and affect remain user-declared or unknown.

The initial restricted-attention profile permits user-initiated candidate capture, bounded acknowledgments, pause/stop/silence and explicitly scoped media transport. Driving, bicycling and uncertain high-risk activity defer consequential actions and prohibit drafting/coaching dialogue and visually dependent review. Spoken confirmation cannot override that restriction. Interruption and material context changes invalidate pending approval; returning to ordinary review never executes deferred work automatically.

Reuse existing evidence, candidate, ContextBundle, admission and append-only audit boundaries. Device handoff and offline failure cannot expand capture, disclosure or action authority. This specifies behavior, not implementation. Quantitative profiles, exact audio-output/confirmation schemas, richer integrations and broader-surface naming remain in `UBU-Q0128`; `UBU-Q0183` retains the release sequence.

```

#### UBU-D0310

```markdown
## UBU-D0310: Restricted-attention interpretations use a closed, request-bound JSON contract

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.1.2. Partially answers `UBU-Q0128` subquestion 6; refines `UBU-D0309` under `UBU-D0299`'s producer grammar rule.

`AudioInterpretationV1` supplies a closed, bounded JSON grammar for the initial candidate-capture, local session-control and scoped media-transport envelope. It carries intent, permitted entity aliases, confidence, ambiguity, load/risk estimates, a typed action or null, confirmation/clarification advice, defer reason and advisory mode safety. Capture references current STT evidence rather than model-written replacement text. Unsupported operations defer; no result can carry an arbitrary tool call, external-message payload or direct speech.

UbU binds each invocation outside the model result to current evidence, context, budget/policy/grant versions, Device, playback state, interaction epoch, finite deadline and idempotency key. It validates the echoed request id against that binding and rechecks freshness and authority before output or dispatch. Interruptions and material changes invalidate late replies. Malformed or inconsistent output cannot be repaired into an action; duplicates and uncertain relative-media outcomes cannot cause automatic repeated transport.

Model estimates never authorize action. Clarification and acknowledgment use bounded controller templates; pause/stop/silence remain available without waiting for a model. Candidate capture retains existing review/admission and provenance rules, and the initial envelope still defers consequential external requests. This specifies behavior, not implementation or driving-safety validation. Quantitative profiles, the serialized budget, external-action confirmation grammar, richer integrations, device-specific behavior and naming remain open in `UBU-Q0128`; `UBU-Q0183` retains the release sequence.

---
```

#### UBU-D0311

```markdown
## UBU-D0311: Restricted-attention budgets use an immutable controller-bound serialization

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.1.2. Partially answers `UBU-Q0128` subquestions 2 and 16; refines `UBU-D0309` and `UBU-D0310` without widening the initial envelope.

`InteractionBudgetV1` is a closed controller-owned JSON snapshot binding the session, Device and interaction epoch to versioned profile, context, policy, grant and endpoint references. It records activity, channels, declared-or-unknown readiness, attention bounds, explicit finite byte/time/choice/clarification caps, closed operation names and fixed review/deferral policies. It is neither an LLM result nor capture consent, a grant or transferable execution approval.

Validate current references, expiry and high-risk invariants before model/tool dispatch or speech. Counters and deadlines belong to the original user turn; clarification and budget renewal cannot reset them. Zero disables the associated resource, while local pause/stop/silence remains available. Clock discontinuity, restart, handoff or material changes invalidate live bindings; synchronized snapshots and audit copies cannot restore authority. Model estimates never widen permissions or certify capacity.

This answers the exact initial-envelope serialization, not quantitative profile defaults or driving-safety validation. `UBU-Q0128` remains Open for profile values, richer interpretation/action shapes, external-action confirmation grammar, messaging/media/coaching integration, device-specific behavior and naming. `UBU-Q0183` retains the delivery sequence. This decision specifies behavior and makes no implementation claim.

```markdown
### 2.13 Realtime and agentic AI boundary

Local camera-and-voice perception is the primary interaction surface and part of the MVP release (`UBU-D0292`, amending `UBU-D0132`). Realtime multimodal models remain replaceable perceptual/extraction backends: they may listen, speak, watch, transcribe, translate, detect interruptions, monitor Task progress, assist meeting capture, or generate candidate UI, but they do not become UbU's authoritative planner. Text and forms remain available, and primary interaction never implies continuous-capture consent.

UbU distinguishes **model-time awareness** from **planner-time semantics**. A model may notice elapsed time, silence, overlapping speech, or changed conditions; UbU decides whether those observations update a Task, Log, Snapshot, Calendar, Objective, or recalculation trigger.

Realtime/discovery functionality must be mode-bound and visible. The user should know whether UbU is off, text-only, in a voice session, in active Discovery mode, in meeting/logging mode, local-only, or cloud-assisted.
```

#### DESIGN.md §4.2 — Phase 1b: Quick UbU merge through the switch

```markdown
### 4.2 Phase 1b: Quick UbU merge through the switch

Phase 1b extends the Phase 1 system until it can replace Quick UbU, the separately developed personal planner that serves as the dogfooding user's working daily tool, so that Quick UbU becomes legacy software (`UBU-D0275`).

Exit criterion:

> The switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU.

Phase 1b closed by decision on 2026-10-10 (`UBU-D0305`), with its planner condition discharged by the greedy Stage 1 certification under the CPU tensor-worker profile (`UBU-D0303`). The ratification gate of `UBU-D0291` was met with no provisional subject root; its registry remains the standing agenda, evaluated at the deferred switch. The switch is not in force and follows the completion of Phase 2.

Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data. (The switch is deferred until Phase 2 is complete (`UBU-D0305`).)

**The Phase 1b rule.** Every Quick UbU feature merged into mainline adopts the restrictions, forms, and functional boundaries of the MVP design it corresponds to, even when that design's implementation phase is later. Open questions that block Phase 1b are answered during Phase 1b whatever phase they were previously tagged, and the items they pull forward are re-tagged Phase 1b.

Phase 1b includes:

- the Phase 1b foundations already decided, including sync-ready mutation envelopes, the Device registry, tombstones, redacted Handles, projection-conflict repair, Device-local credentials, the local advisory worker, advisory batches, and first-class advisory candidate review;
- the Quick UbU practical features, ported under the Phase 1b rule;
- the planner the switch requires: decomposition into Containers whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together (§9.4); an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks (§7.4.1); partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend with its CPU reference path (§16.10).

**MVP-release scope amendment (`UBU-D0292`).** Local camera-and-voice interaction, including explicitly enabled realtime capture, enters the Phase 1b release backlog. This is a release commitment, not a claim that capture is implemented or a retroactive change to frozen Phase 1. `UBU-Q0183` leaves the exact capture modes, supported devices and sequence relative to the switch and existing device waves to an operator roadmap decision. `UBU-D0305` amends the Phase 1b exit criterion; release completion cannot be inferred from closing Phase 1b alone. `UBU-Q0128` is re-tagged Phase 1b, so Phase 3 no longer gates the primary interaction surface. Always-on behavior is not required. Mobile interaction versus mobile planning workload remains open in `UBU-Q0160`, without amending `UBU-D0290`.

The richer household apprentice, maintenance triage, purchasing defense, Skill evidence and tacit-expertise examples depend on first-class Technique, Resource and Skill implementations. They are phased but unimplemented dependencies: Phase 3 supplies minimal readiness and Technique-based Objective expansion, and Phase 4 supplies richer integration. Evidence semantics, hardware suitability and scenario-specific scope remain unresolved. Camera-first MVP scope does not promise that those later planning objects or scenarios are MVP-ready.

Phase 1b defers multi-device sync and everything else assigned to Phase 2 and later.
```

#### DESIGN.md §11.2 — UniverseState values

```markdown
### 11.2 UniverseState values

MVP value discipline:

- fact keys are free-form strings;
- default keys should use a lightweight namespace convention;
- values are text / JSON-like payloads.

**Namespace convention (`UBU-D0243`, amended by `UBU-D0291`).** A target is `<collection>.<subject>(.<entity-path>)?.<predicate>`. The first segment after the collection is a permanent top-level taxonomy referenced by every fact, precondition and mutation, so it remains governed and reviewed. Its effective vocabulary is the governed set union one visible operator-authored provisional registry. The governed set remains `operator`, `project`, `github`, `affect`, `relationship`, and only a recorded amending decision extends it. Minting a provisional root is an explicit operator act, never a side effect of recording a fact and never available to an advisor; producers may use only the effective vocabulary. Every root is a snake_case singular noun naming an entity or domain, never an instance, attribute, provenance/source or reverse-DNS authority prefix. Predicates and entity paths retain their existing rules. `affect` retains its reserved meaning, and `UBU-D0242`'s intrinsic-affect rejection keys off `<subject> == affect` unchanged.

Every provisional root must be ratified by an amending decision or retired before the switch; the registry is that agenda. The store is disposable until the switch, making that the last cheap rename point before UniverseState keys, fact_provenance keys and Task precondition strings require rewriting without migration tooling. No root is proposed here. Registry, minting and validator/advisor enforcement are follow-up orchestrator work, not implemented by this ticket.

The Phase 1b Tasks form reads requirements in words and authors a single leaf. Boolean trees remain readable and clearable, and authorable through the existing routes; a tree editor is outside the form's scope.

A stricter ontology can be added later.

**Human authoring and target advice (`UBU-D0296`, `UBU-D0300`).** The UniverseState form offers `asserted` for a person's statement and `measured` for an instrument/reading; it does not offer `derived` or `proposed`. A UniverseTarget advisor proposes only a target name, without a value. Its admission requires the operator's own value and records an assertion through the ordinary mutation path. No current advisor suggests values.

**Perceptual provenance (`UBU-D0293`).** The closed enum remains `asserted / measured / derived / proposed`, not a confidence ladder. Unconfirmed visual observation or inference maps to a `proposed` candidate, never a canonical value. Personal confirmation maps to `asserted`, instrument/reading evidence to `measured`, and an actual computation from facts to `derived`. External verification qualifies the evidence and keeps the underlying source kind. Candidate/Discovery evidence carries observation, confidence and corroboration qualifiers; `FactProvenance` remains only `{kind, recorded_at}`. This future perceptual mapping does not implement value proposals or broaden the existing advisors' authority.
```

#### DESIGN.md §12.2 — Discovery mode

```markdown
### 12.2 Discovery mode

**Discovery mode** is a user-selectable workflow state, not a fourth instance operating mode. It is off by default and may be started, paused, resumed, exited, or inspected by the user at any time. The UI must show active capture state, enabled sources, local/cloud routing status, retention limits, and pending-review evidence count.

Phase 1 session states are `inactive`, `active`, `paused`, `ended`, and `pending_review`. A minimal `DiscoveryEvidenceItem` is a reviewable candidate artifact with session ref, effective time or interval, source kind, signal kind, payload ref or redacted summary, confidence, Compartment or low-security label, provenance, and review status. Raw evidence is not final truth.

Allowed Phase 1 discovery inputs are intentionally narrow:

- explicit quick notes, user-selected current action, voice or text notes intentionally captured by the user, and manual start/stop markers;
- UbU app state, Task controls, Calendar or default Plan context, timers, focus state, and foreground app category or app identifier when explicitly enabled;
- configured integration events already allowed by Compartment, External Event, and External Reference policy;
- coarse motion category such as stationary, walking, transit, or driving;
- coarse user-defined location category or geofence event, not continuous raw location by default;
- device state needed for interpretation, such as screen on/off or network/offline state.

Phase 1 discovery excludes covert or broad capture by default: continuous microphone, camera, screen recording, keystroke logging, raw message bodies, raw file contents, raw GPS trails, and cross-Identity sharing are outside the default discovery input set. Any later use of those sources requires a separate explicit mode, Compartment review, routing disclosure, and user approval.

**AV refinement for the MVP interaction surface (`UBU-D0292`).** The primary camera-and-voice surface does not enable continuous sources implicitly. A consented capture session remains visible, source-scoped, pausable and inspectable under the clause above. Process raw AV locally on the operator's own hardware, minimize context and retain only material justified by its purpose. Selective clips, summaries, hashes or deletion are operator-controlled under Compartment policy; subsequent export needs its own allowed route and approval. No-cloud/no-export denials remain hard. Exact defaults, segmentation and deletion mechanics remain open in `UBU-Q0169`–`UBU-Q0171`; recording a policy does not claim its enforcement has shipped.

Selective raw-media retention and append-only evidence are distinct. Discarding a raw stream or deleting an authorized clip does not edit an admitted historical claim in place: append minimized correction, revocation, deletion or tombstone metadata with the appropriate links. The immutable Log retains evidence about what was asserted, reviewed or withdrawn, not an automatic reconstructible copy of private raw media. A hash is not proof of an event and can itself leak correlation; policy must govern it. Later views can mark deleted evidence unavailable without inventing a replacement observation. `UBU-Q0162` tracks the reported Log-editability enforcement gap.

Admission rules:

- A user-confirmed actual action that reconciles a planned interval is recorded with `plan_realized`; if it completes, fails, or moots a Task, the corresponding Task lifecycle Log is also written.
- A user override of the current recommendation records `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind = system_recommendation_overridden`, `authority_source = user_override`, chosen action or Task when known, optional reason, and a `user_override` recalculation trigger when planner-relevant.
- A user-declared current state becomes a Snapshot only when it asserts observed state such as affect, availability, location category, or capacity.
- Preferences change only through explicit accepted pairwise Preference statements. Repeated behavior and inferred reasons are not Preferences.
- Task estimates, dependencies, status, Objective annotations, or Objective status change only after user acceptance or normal validated admission. Otherwise the item remains an unresolved review item.

Undetailed periods should be represented with uncertainty rather than filled in by inference. The review UI should allow `unknown`, `private`, `rest`, `interruption`, `planned Task`, `different Task`, `quick note`, `other`, and free-text correction. UbU must not infer Preference changes, Objective failure, habit patterns, or moral meaning from unknown or private time.

Before treating repeated behavior as a habit pattern, UbU must ask a clarification prompt such as: `I have seen this pattern more than once: [behavior] during [context]. Should UbU plan around it, help you change it, treat it as not a pattern, or leave it unresolved?` Valid answers are `endorse_and_plan_around`, `tolerate_but_review`, `unwanted_help_change`, `not_a_pattern`, and `leave_unresolved`.

Discovery mode preserves sovereignty by remaining visible, opt-in, source-scoped, pausable, inspectable, and correctable. Users may reject, delete where retention policy permits, mark private/unknown, correct, defer, or accept evidence before it becomes canonical state. Compartment policy, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed-device, and allowed-integration denials remain hard boundaries.

## 21. Agentic Interaction, MCP, and Delegation Substrate

This section records the post-realtime LLM and agentic-platform design direction. The core rule is that unstructured AI can observe, converse, propose, and act under authority, but UbU remains the canonical state-transition, review, privacy, and planning layer.

### 21.1 Realtime interaction sessions and candidate updates

A realtime interaction session is a bounded period in which UbU receives a continuous or semi-continuous stream from text, voice, video, sensors, tools, or a model provider.

Possible session modes include:

- `off`;
- `text_only`;
- `voice_session`;
- `meeting_logging`;
- `discovery_mode`;
- `local_only_realtime`;
- `cloud_assisted_realtime`.

Realtime sessions may produce candidate updates, but they do not directly mutate canonical state. Candidate update types include observed events, interruption signals, Task progress deltas, affect signals, Plan deviations, external condition changes, clarification questions, WorkItem candidates, LogEntry candidates, and AssociationAttestation candidates.

A realtime model's sense of elapsed time is evidence. Planner-time semantics are determined by UbU's explicit Task, Plan, Calendar, Log, Snapshot, and recalculation rules.

Realtime models are replaceable interaction backends for the primary MVP camera-and-voice surface (`UBU-D0292`), including conversation, capture, triage and short-horizon repair. UbU represents a realtime run as a lightweight `RealtimeInteractionSession`, not as a Task, Calendar event, canonical Log entry, or raw sensor stream. A session records the consented interaction context and source boundary; the model's outputs are `RealtimeCandidateUpdate` records until admitted through the ordinary planner, Log, Snapshot, Compartment, and review rules.

The minimum `RealtimeInteractionSession` record contains `interaction_session_id`, `schema_version`, `instance_id`, `actor_identity_ref`, `device_ref`, `started_at`, optional `ended_at`, `session_state`, `source_modes`, `backend_ref`, `model_or_tool_ref`, prompt or template version, enabled input sources, `compartment_ids`, `disclosure_policy`, retention or redaction policy, routing mode, evidence item refs, candidate update refs, provenance, review status, and correction or revocation links. Session states align with discovery mode where applicable: `inactive`, `active`, `paused`, `ended`, and `pending_review`.

The minimum `RealtimeCandidateUpdate` record contains `candidate_update_id`, `schema_version`, optional `interaction_session_id`, `emitted_at`, effective instant or interval, `candidate_type`, optional `target_ref`, payload, source evidence refs or excerpt hashes, per-field provenance, confidence, `compartment_ids`, redaction level, routing mode, review status, admission hint, idempotency key, and correction, rejection, revocation, or supersession links. The Phase 1b candidate types required for Quick UbU are `tag`, `dependency`, `preference`, `decomposition`, and `clarification_question`. Additional allowed candidate types are `interruption`, `task_progress`, `affect_signal`, `external_condition_change`, `plan_deviation`, `log_candidate`, `task_candidate`, and `association_attestation_candidate`, but each remains subject to its existing schema, authority, review, and Compartment gates.

A realtime candidate never mutates admitted state by itself. A tag, dependency, decomposition, preference, Task, Log, Snapshot, Calendar, Plan-deviation, or AssociationAttestation effect becomes canonical only after user acceptance, validated admission, or a specific local policy grant for that exact mutation class. Rejected, corrected, superseded, or revoked candidates remain auditable according to the candidate lifecycle rules.

Model-noticed elapsed time is represented as evidence or a candidate interval, not as planner-valid Task execution, Calendar occupancy, or Log truth. Planned time is reconciled only through accepted `plan_realized`, Task lifecycle, Calendar, Snapshot, or Log records. Unknown, private, rest, interruption, different-Task, and quick-note intervals preserve uncertainty and must not create Preference changes, Objective failures, habit claims, or moral meaning by inference.

Mandatory provenance for realtime observations includes source kind, capture or observation interval, device and backend refs, model or tool identifier, prompt or template digest where applicable, parser or schema version, evidence refs or payload hashes, source Compartment, redaction level, processing route, confidence, and review status. Audio, video, screen, keystroke, raw message, raw file, raw GPS, and similarly sensitive sources also require explicit source enablement and policy-visible capture state before they can produce candidates.

Routing defaults are conservative. Local-only processing is required for raw sensitive capture, `no_cloud_llm` Compartments, and sources whose policy denies external processing. Cloud processing is optional only for policy-approved, user-visible, redacted or intentionally provided inputs. Cross-user projection, external export, covert capture, broad background capture, hidden persuasion timing, and automatic external mutation are prohibited unless a later explicit mode, Compartment policy, capability grant, and user approval allow that exact behavior.

#### 21.1.1 Observation, context and closed-loop execution

The architecture is observation → candidate objects/facts → Identity and object resolution against permitted persistent context → candidate UniverseState/Resource implications → proposed preconditions or constraints → CPU semantic/policy/conflict validation and operator admission → planning or recalculation over admitted state. Ambiguous identity matches remain alternatives, not merged objects. The camera can suggest the relevance of an observed object to the user's life; it cannot infer intent, affect, Preference changes or ownership as self-certifying truth.

Confidence helps choose high-information clarification, not bypass admission. Corroboration is consequence-sensitive: escalate evidence and human review when an interpretation could change a consequential action; unknown or incompatible evidence stays unresolved. An observation consistent with completion is not proof that the modeled effect occurred. `UBU-D0293` defines source-kind mapping; `UBU-D0320` specifies the observation binding/admission contract below; `UBU-D0321` specifies qualifier preservation. `UBU-Q0166`, `UBU-Q0167` and `UBU-Q0172` retain host-mapping evidence, corroboration and proof-of-effect questions. Existing candidate/Discovery records are the reuse point, not newly implemented perception schemas.

The execution loop is **See → understand → plan → direct → observe → verify → learn → update**. Understanding proposes interpretations; planning remains the kernel's; direction presents an inspectable next action; new observations prompt reconciliation; verification uses the required evidence and operator review; learning proposes model corrections; only admitted updates close the loop. Inference never certifies itself by being repeated downstream. Technique guidance, observed Skill development and procedure-to-Technique capture depend on the later-phase objects and unresolved evidence/safety questions, not merely access to a camera. See [the interaction document](MULTIMODAL_INTERACTION.md) and [the security boundary](MULTIMODAL_SECURITY.md).

**Observation binding profile (`UBU-D0320`).** Reuse `DiscoveryEvidenceItem` (§12.2) for captured evidence and unresolved interpretations, and per-object `AdvisoryCandidate` records (§21.2.1) for supported proposals. One evidence item may support several candidates; accepting one interpretation never accepts the others. Store the following `observation-admission/1` bindings in their existing payload/evidence slots alongside the native normalized proposal. This is a payload contract, not a new first-class perception object, candidate-kind enum or `FactProvenance` extension. A producer's version-pinned adapter must validate its mapping to the host schemas; an unsupported or lossy mapping stays unresolved and needs separate versioned review under `UBU-Q0166`.

| Binding | Required content and interpretation |
|---|---|
| `profile` | Exactly `observation-admission/1`; retain the host record's own schema version separately. Unknown profiles cannot be admitted. |
| `sources` | Nonempty list of `{evidence_ref, evidence_version, source_ref, session_ref, session_version, selector, effective_start, effective_end}`. The controller supplies/resolves these refs; selectors locate a retained frame, span, reading or policy-permitted summary within that source, not model-invented evidence. Endpoints are timezone-bearing timestamps with start <= end; equal endpoints denote an instant. One-shot capture also has a session ref. The captured session revision establishes source enablement at acquisition time; it is not a live grant for later processing or execution. Evidence provenance retains origin Device, source/signal kind, capture enablement and route/policy refs, backend/model/tool, parser/schema version, template digest where applicable, confidence and permitted hashes. |
| `context` | `{context_bundle_ref, digest}` binding the exact permitted context used, or `null` only if no persistent context was consulted. Every context-based match must resolve to this bundle's supplied refs. A model cannot search denied context, mint a canonical ref, or substitute a fresh context for the one used. |
| `subjects` | List of `{observation_key, alternatives, selection}`; observation keys are unique within the capture and are not canonical entity ids. Each alternative is either `{object_ref, object_version}` or `{candidate_ref, candidate_version, proposed_object_key}`. An empty alternatives list means unknown; `selection: null` means unresolved. Selection is either null or `{alternative_index, review_event_ref}`; only explicit operator resolution selects an alternative. Confidence, coincident labels or repeated sightings cannot merge Identities/objects or establish ownership. |
| `proposal` and `claim_evidence` | The native normalized proposal (null for evidence without a supported proposal), plus `claim_evidence: [{field_path, evidence_refs}]` covering every proposed field change. Paths are nonempty arrays of native field names or zero-based array indices; evidence refs are nonempty lists drawn from `sources`. With no proposal, claim_evidence is empty. UniverseState implications use §11.3's `operation`/`target`/`payload` rules; proposed preconditions use §10.1. Unknown/omitted fields propose no write or deletion; a literal JSON null value must be an explicit claim. Source kinds follow `UBU-D0293`; confidence and corroboration stay in evidence, while `FactProvenance` remains `{kind, recorded_at}`. |
| `dependencies` | List of `{candidate_ref, candidate_version, proposal_path}` for proposed-object/value links used by the proposal; paths use the same field-path syntax. Object creations also name `proposed_object_key`. Such links are candidate-local, never canonical ids. Admission must resolve them to already-admitted records/values or changes in the same validated atomic batch; otherwise defer. Native schemas that cannot express these links retain the interpretation as Discovery evidence. |
| `observed_versions` | Ref-to-version map covering every evidence item, resolved target and context input relied on, plus referenced candidate dependencies. Where a current-state container has no internal version, bind its admitted envelope/frontier digest; do not invent UniverseState history. Creates bind a stable proposed-object key and an explicit create-only/expected-absence condition. Review also binds the candidate's own current version. |
| `observed_policy_versions` | Ref-to-version map of all relied-on capture, routing, Compartment, retention and admission policies. Current policy, not capture-time permission alone, governs review and admission. |
| `predecessors` | `{evidence: [{evidence_ref, evidence_version}], candidates: [{candidate_ref, candidate_version}], logs: [log_entry_id]}` using the host's correction/supersession links. Admitted-history corrections cite original Log ids under §17.3. Empty lists mean an original interpretation, not absence of earlier world events. |

**Perceptual qualifier preservation (`UBU-D0321`).** Use a companion `perceptual-qualifiers/1` payload in the existing evidence payload/ref and candidate evidence/per-field slots. Keep the host schema version and `observation-admission/1` bindings separate and unchanged. These are payload requirements, not new first-class objects, candidate kinds or `FactProvenance` fields. Reuse is conditional on a validated host mapping; an opaque payload slot described in prose is not proof that its schema, serializer and store preserve the content.

| Payload content | Required preservation and links |
|---|---|
| `profile` | Exactly `perceptual-qualifiers/1`. Unknown versions remain unresolved; adapters cannot silently discard or reinterpret them. |
| Evidence `claims` | List of `{claim_key, content, qualifications}`. Keys are stable and unique within an evidence revision, not canonical object ids. Content retains the exact permitted source statement or structured interpretation, including target/identity alternatives, attribution, negation, conditions, quantities, units and uncertainty. A summary alone is insufficient when it drops these distinctions. Evidence without a supported native proposal still retains its claims. |
| Claim `qualifications` | Separate entries for `observed`, `inferred`, `operator_confirmed` and `externally_verified`; several may concern the same claim. Each entry retains `{term, attribution, effective_start, effective_end, recorded_at, confidence, basis, related_claims}` and resolves to its enclosing evidence revision and the binding profile's source/session/selector. Attribution identifies the actual person, external source or model/tool and its applicable revision, using controller-resolved refs or explicit unknown metadata. Observation and recording times remain distinct. Additional relied-on sources join `sources` and `observed_versions`. These terms are evidence labels, never additions to `ProvenanceKind` or an ordered confidence rank. |
| Qualification `confidence` | Original score, scale, meaning/method and producing source/model revision, or explicit null when unreported. Preserve differing per-claim/per-source estimates; a candidate aggregate cannot replace them. Unreported is neither zero nor certainty, and confirmation/verification cannot synthesize a confidence score. |
| Qualification `basis` | Retain how the claim was established and the underlying kind under `UBU-D0293`. Observation cites the permitted frame/span/reading; inference retains model/tool revision, input refs, assumptions and unresolved alternatives. A personal confirmation retains the actual statement and speaker; an instrument reading retains instrument ref, reading, units, method and supplied accuracy/calibration qualifications. An actual derivation retains version-bound input facts/evidence, admitted envelope/frontier bindings for canonical inputs, rule/tool revision, parameters and result. Unreported optional details stay explicitly unknown; missing evidence of an actual instrument/reading or computation cannot justify `measured` or `derived`. |
| External-verification basis | Additionally retain verifier/source ref, exact claim and scope checked, verification time, method, result including inconclusive/disputed outcomes, and supporting evidence refs/versions. The verifier's attestation provenance is distinct from the checked claim's underlying kind. Verification of an interpretation neither changes its original kind nor supplies an admission event. |
| Qualification `related_claims` | List of `{evidence_ref, evidence_version, claim_key, relation}` locating claims supported, contradicted, confirmed, verified, computed from or sharing a source. Preserve source ancestry and dependency links so a repeated interpretation, copied report or reused frame cannot appear as independent corroboration. Unknown independence remains unknown; sufficiency remains `UBU-Q0167`. |
| Candidate `field_qualifiers` | List of `{field_path, claim_refs: [{evidence_ref, evidence_version, claim_key}]}` covering every path in `claim_evidence`. Use that binding's native field-path syntax; refs resolve to claims in its version-bound `sources`. Each mapped path has nonempty claim refs. One field may have conflicting or differently qualified evidence. Evidence-only records have no candidate field mapping. A partial acceptance binds only the reviewed subset and its supporting claims; other claims remain unaccepted. |

**Confirmation, review and retention.** A later confirmation, reading, derivation or verification creates separately attributed evidence and a linked candidate revision where needed; it never edits an earlier inference into a different source. Acceptance is an ordinary review event, distinct from a source confirmation. Bind the exact candidate revision, field mapping and evidence revisions to that event and its resulting mutation/Log/Snapshot refs through `UBU-D0320`'s atomic admission links. The companion payload is part of bound operation content; changing it follows the same revision, idempotency and fresh-review rules. Admitted kind follows the actual accepted assertion, reading or computation under `UBU-D0293`; `FactProvenance` remains `{kind, recorded_at}`. Review presents qualifiers, contradictions and attribution rather than only a confidence badge. `UniverseTarget` stays name-only, and unsupported value/computation paths stay evidence-only.

Losslessness means preservation of the permitted retained claims, qualifications and links through normalization, storage, review and authorized exchange; it does not require retaining raw media beyond policy. Redaction, purge or an incomplete Replica must indicate only permitted unavailability/incompleteness, never imply an absent qualifier was false or reconstruct disallowed content from retained derivatives. Inherit all source restrictions. Missing required bindings block admission under `UBU-D0320`; loss of evidence neither automatically retracts nor reaffirms admitted history.

**Host-mapping gate (`UBU-Q0166`).** Before enabling an adapter, pin the producer/adapter, host schemas, Rust/JSON serializers, store/review API and exchange revisions and policy configuration. Publish the exact host field paths or payload-ref mapping for every row above, with serialized fixture inputs and retrieved outputs. Compare structured values and all ids, versions, field paths, attributions, times, qualifiers and links after validation, serialization, persistence/reload, review and authorized exchange. Structural round-trip fidelity establishes preservation, not perceptual truth or evidence sufficiency. Exercise:

- a visual hypothesis with both observation and inference, differing field confidences and incompatible alternatives, with no canonical write;
- a later personal assertion, actual instrument reading and actual computation from versioned admitted facts, preserving each original interpretation and selecting only the source-appropriate admitted kind through supported paths;
- scoped external verification, inconclusive/disputed verification and two reports sharing one original source, retaining lineage without automatic admission or independent-corroboration claims;
- correction, partial acceptance, restart/replay, unavailable/purged evidence and policy-restricted partial exchange, retaining exact permitted links and exposing no denied content;
- unknown profile, unsupported host fields, serializer field dropping/defaulting and dangling claim/version refs, preventing admission rather than silently flattening qualifiers.

No passing host mapping or schema gap is asserted here. A mapping that cannot preserve this content stays unresolved with a policy-permitted diagnostic. A demonstrated gap needs a separately reviewed versioned schema/type/store chain change and any required pins/migration; this payload contract makes none.

**Supported operations.** Validate the native proposal against an already-supported candidate kind and ordinary admission operation before enqueueing an executable review proposal. Unresolved targets, unsupported object kinds and perceptual values without a supported adapter remain Discovery review evidence with the limitation visible; they cannot fall through to a generic mutation executor. `UniverseTarget` advice remains name-only under `UBU-D0296`: it cannot carry, default or admit a perceptual value. The operator may author a value through the ordinary assertion/measurement form linked to the evidence. Future perceptual value-candidate support requires its separately reviewed versioned adapter; this contract does not enable it. Intent, affect, Preferences, completion/effect claims and later-phase Resources/Skills/Techniques retain their existing source and admission gates.

**Disclosure and session scope.** Evidence, candidates, alternatives, selectors, hashes and derivative review material inherit all supporting sources' disclosure/routing/retention restrictions; reference-only payloads do not waive them. Denied matches cannot leak identifiers, labels or existence through alternatives or counts. Reviewing permitted retained evidence is allowed after its capture session is paused/ended; it neither restarts capture nor transfers source consent or pending approval to another Device.

**Replay and corrections.** The controller assigns stable evidence ids and capture keys scoped to source/session and source item or span. It assigns separate candidate-creation and review-operation idempotency keys, each bound to its immutable originating operation rather than later lifecycle state. Exact retries, restart and exchange preserve ids, versions, normalized content and keys; the same key with different bound content is rejected, never treated as a harmless duplicate. Distinct observations are not deduplicated by their meaning or time alone. Equivalent repeated proposals use §21.2.1's suppression/deferral rules rather than resetting rejected/deferred state. New material evidence or a correction creates a linked revision/replacement with a new key. Superseded versions and late interpretations cannot overwrite an operator correction or use an old approval. Corrections to admitted claims append §17.3 entries and any separately admitted replacement Snapshot/mutation; they never rewrite the original. Raw-media purge marks supporting evidence unavailable and obeys existing retention policy; it neither fabricates replacement evidence nor automatically retracts or reaffirms a claim.

**Review and admission.** Present the source/session and observation time, permitted evidence or an explicit unavailable/redacted indicator, proposed-versus-current diff, source kind, uncertainty/contradictions, alternative matches, dependencies and resulting planning implications. Show the exact fields and batch being accepted; accepting an evidence item alone does not authorize every linked proposal. Offer resolve/edit, accept, reject, defer and private/unknown through existing Discovery/advisory review; edits record the operator's source, create a new bound revision and require fresh review. A permitted partial acceptance creates a bound revision or separate candidate for its exact subset and coherent dependency batch; unaccepted interpretations remain unresolved. If required evidence or target bindings cannot be established, retain an unresolved review item. Restricted attention defers unavailable review under §21.1.2.

At acceptance, the CPU rechecks the exact candidate/target/dependency versions and evidence/context/source revisions, including whether the latter remain available and unsuperseded, dependency bindings, current authority and Device trust, current source/disclosure/admission policy and native semantic/conflict rules. Changed bindings invalidate approval; require fresh review rather than silently rebasing. Source confirmation records new evidence of the actual assertion, reading or derivation; it does not relabel the original inference as measured or derived. Commit the ordinary canonical change, review decision with actor/`authority_source`/Device/times/observed versions, resulting Log/Snapshot refs, candidate admission links and idempotency outcome as one crash-consistent unit. Rejection/deferral records only ordinary review metadata, not the proposed world state. Recalculation follows admitted planner-relevant changes. Candidate persistence, successful extraction, high confidence and queue order confer no canonical, projection or external-action authority; external execution requires its own current checks and approval.

**Required fixtures.** Before enabling a producer/adapter, pin its revision, host schemas and policy configuration, and serialize the following scenarios through the real validators, review storage and admission reducer. Fixture labels below denote distinct stable schema-valid ids. Record exact input payloads/versions, decisions, candidate/evidence links, expected canonical diffs/Logs and replay outcomes. These are required acceptance cases, not passing implementation results.

| Fixture input and action | Required outcome |
|---|---|
| Evidence `E1@v1`, session `S1@v1`, frame selector `frame:12`, `proposal: null`; evidence payload contains a visual hypothesis `{"operation":"set_fact","target":"facts.project.ubu.build_result","payload":"passed"}`; no value adapter or confirmation | Discovery review evidence only; no UniverseState, Snapshot, Task, Plan, Calendar or projection effect. Existing UniverseTarget advice still contains no value. |
| Supported precondition proposal `C1@v1` for `T1@v7` (prior precondition absent) uses `E1@v1`, context `B1`, policy `P1@v3` and a recorded target; capture session S1 has ended. Proposes `{"target":"facts.project.ubu.build_result","predicate":"equals","expected":"passed"}`, operator edits expected to `"reviewed"` and accepts the bound revision | Only T1's precondition becomes that leaf with expected `"reviewed"`; the fact's value is unchanged. Ordinary decision/Log links are admitted once. Review restarts no capture; repeat submission, restart and exchange produce no second effect. |
| Observation key `person:1` has permitted alternatives `I1@v2` and `I2@v4`, selection null, confidence 0.99; operator leaves unresolved or selects `I2` | Unresolved creates no merge/ownership/fact; selection affects only the newly reviewed proposal bound to `I2@v4`, without accepting other interpretations. |
| A proposal references proposed-object key `o1` from `C2@v1`, or a value from `C3@v1`; the dependency is pending, rejected, or admitted | No phantom object, dangling value link or planner use of a candidate value. Pending/rejected dependency prevents dependent admission; an approved atomic dependency batch or fresh review against admitted refs/values resolves it exactly once. |
| Between presentation and acceptance, `T1@v7` becomes `v8`, evidence/context is superseded, policy changes, or the originating/acting Device is revoked | No stale/unauthorized admission. Preserve only permitted review material and require the ordinary fresh-review, rejection or conflict path. |
| Duplicate `E1/C1` with identical keys/content; then the same key with changed value/target; then a genuinely new observation `E2` | Exact replay collapses; changed-content key reuse rejects; `E2` remains distinct and cannot automatically revive a rejection or satisfy corroboration by repetition. |
| Crash before or after the canonical-change/review/idempotency transaction; retry the same approval operation | Either no effect or the complete single admitted effect and its linked review/Log/outcome; never an orphan mutation, false admission acknowledgment or duplicate effect. |
| Operator corrects `E1/C1` before a delayed result arrives, and separately corrects an already-admitted claim | Late result cannot restore the superseded claim. Unadmitted replacement needs fresh review; admitted correction appends links and any accepted replacement without editing historical records. |
| Supporting raw evidence is purged, or a partial Replica lacks/denies a required source/target; manual text replaces capture | Show only permitted unavailable/incomplete metadata and no denied identifiers or Compartment labels. Missing bindings block that admission; a new operator-authored submission uses its actual source and fresh bindings without recreating deleted media or widening disclosure. |
| Missing required binding, unknown profile/schema, model-invented ref, malformed native proposal or hard routing/Compartment denial | No dispatch/admission; only policy-permitted evidence and an unresolved/rejected diagnostic through existing machinery. |
| Explicit operator assertion, instrument reading and actual derivation through supported ordinary authoring/computation paths; high-confidence apparent Task completion without the required effect evidence | Admitted kinds follow `UBU-D0293` with unchanged FactProvenance fields and retained original candidate links; unsupported derivation paths remain evidence-only. Apparent completion alone creates no lifecycle/effect update, inferred affect/intent or Preference. |

`UBU-D0321` specifies qualifier content and fidelity gates; `UBU-Q0166` retains revision-pinned host-mapping evidence and demonstrated schema-gap review. `UBU-Q0167` retains consequence-sensitive evidence sufficiency; `UBU-Q0169`–`UBU-Q0171` retain capture/retention mechanics; `UBU-Q0172` retains proof-of-effect semantics. This contract freezes bindings, reuse and admission behavior without claiming those questions or implementation acceptance are complete.

#### 21.1.2 Restricted-attention audio envelope

**Embodied Audio Interaction (`UBU-D0309`).** Activity mode is separate from the realtime session's source/routing mode and from `compartment_ids`: for example, `Mode: Driving` with `Compartment: UbU Project / Public Outreach`. Activity constrains interaction; Compartment policy constrains disclosure and authority. Neither grants permission supplied by the other.

The initial activity vocabulary covers driving, bicycling, walking, running (including jogging), stationary exercise, resting, cooking, housework, showering, passenger transit, user-defined and unknown contexts. Operator selection establishes the intended mode. Explicitly enabled coarse activity evidence may tighten restrictions, but never starts capture or relaxes them. Driving, bicycling and conflicting or uncertain high-risk activity use the high-risk envelope; stopping motion alone does not establish parked review readiness.

A controller-owned, session-local `InteractionBudget` records:

- budget id and version, session and Device refs, activity mode, source/freshness of context, applicable policy refs, `compartment_ids` and expiry;
- permitted input/output channels and audio endpoint, manual availability, visual attention, locomotion risk, interruptibility, working-memory budget, intellectual/emotional bandwidth and social-risk tolerance;
- finite maximum prompt and response lengths, turn duration, choices and clarification count, permitted operation classes, confirmation policy and deferral policy.

Capacity and affect are user-declared or unknown, never a model-certified assessment of intelligence or readiness. Unknown capacity uses the conservative profile; observations may reduce the budget, not expand permissions. Effective permissions are the intersection of the reviewed activity profile, current channel/attention limits, Compartment policy and scoped capability grants. Missing, expired or conflicting authority prevents model/tool dispatch; pause, stop and silence controls remain available. Numeric profile defaults remain in `UBU-Q0128`; the exact initial-envelope serialization is specified below (`UBU-D0311`). A profile cannot ship without finite caps.

**Serialized budget (`UBU-D0311`).** `InteractionBudgetV1` is the controller's immutable snapshot for the initial envelope, not an LLM result, capability grant, capture consent or portable approval. All keys are required and all objects are closed. Reject duplicate keys, trailing content, non-finite numbers and unknown schema versions without repair. References identify controller artifacts or existing records; referenced versions use opaque revision tokens such as `v12`, preserving existing version conventions. `budget_version` and `interaction_epoch` are session-local integer counters. The model receives only a purpose-limited projection of effective limits through its ContextBundle, never authority to edit or return this object.

**Budget semantics.** JSON shape validation is followed by these controller checks; no missing value is defaulted into permission:

- The budget must be the current controller-issued id/version for this session, Device and interaction epoch. Referenced profile, context evidence, policies, grants and endpoint revisions must match current permitted records; each ref set has at most one version per ref. Include every policy/grant used to determine this envelope; metadata overflow fails closed rather than omitting restrictions. Context sources and readiness declarations must match the kind of evidence referenced. `user_defined` requires an explicitly reviewed profile, rather than a free-form label selecting permissions. Coarse evidence may only maintain or tighten the operator-selected mode. Unknown or conflicting activity cannot relax the high-risk envelope.
- Times are integer milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Require `context.observed_at_ms <= issued_at_ms <= now`, and `now < min(expires_at_ms, context.expires_at_ms)`; profile, policy and grant expiry further shorten validity. Bind the remaining lifetime and turn deadline to the local monotonic clock. Clock discontinuity or restart invalidates the snapshot; wall-clock rollback cannot extend it. A new Device recomputes a budget under its own current policy.
- Attention fields are engagement bounds, not diagnostic scores. Known working-memory, intellectual/emotional bandwidth or social-risk tolerance requires the referenced, fresh user declaration; otherwise those fields are `unknown` and the conservative profile supplies finite limits. Profiles may tighten declared limits, never infer improved capacity. Driving, bicycling, high/unknown locomotion risk or conflicting high-risk evidence requires the high-risk envelope, `manual_availability = none`, `visual_attention = none`, `max_choices = 0` and `max_clarifications <= 1`. Zero choices prohibits menus, not one permitted brief reference clarification.
- Every limit is an explicit nonnegative integer; zero disables the corresponding resource. Positive values must be within the reviewed profile and current policy, channel and grant ceilings. Quantitative profile values remain in `UBU-Q0128`; absent ceilings prevent dispatch. These wire bounds are not usability defaults or evidence of driving safety.
- Counters belong to the original user turn, outside the model result. `max_capture_ms` and `max_stt_utf8_bytes` bound total authorized user audio and STT text for that turn. Model byte caps cover the complete normalized invocation (instructions, context, grammar and tool declarations) and complete outputs, cumulatively across that turn; apply the output cap before parsing. Spoken prompt/response byte caps and `max_speech_ms` cover cumulative controller prompts/acknowledgments, measured in UTF-8 bytes and elapsed speech time. `max_turn_ms` runs from the first user audio frame through final speech/dispatch, including waits and clarification; renewal or clarification never resets counters or revives an invalid binding. Exceeding a cap stops that processing/output path and leaves only already-authorized unresolved evidence for review, without truncating text into an executable interpretation or retrying automatically.
- `local_controls` and all three session-control operations are mandatory; immediate local pause/stop/silence remains available even without a valid budget. Speech input still needs the session's explicit source consent. Speech output requires a non-null fresh endpoint, nonzero speech limits and current disclosure permission; a known endpoint is not proof of privacy. Empty output channels mean silence. Zero model limits prevent model invocation; zero clarification allowance removes that branch from `AudioInterpretationV1`.
- `allowed_operations` is only a cached intersection of the initial envelope and current authority, rechecked at dispatch. `capture_candidate` maps to either existing capture variant; session and media names map to their exact v1 operations. Media requires the scoped integration grant and fresh request-bound playback target. `candidate_review_only` leaves capture unadmitted while permitted session/media controls need no admission; `ordinary_review_no_auto_dispatch` retains unsupported or prohibited requests for fresh ordinary review. No operation admits canonical state or authorizes consequential external execution.

Issue a superseding budget/version and invalidate request bindings on material context, mode, Device, endpoint, profile, policy or grant change, or on expiry. Synchronized/audit copies cannot restore a live budget, microphone consent or pending approval. Before enabling this contract, exercise missing/extra fields, non-integer/negative limits, stale revisions, replay after restart/handoff, clock rollback, missing endpoint permission, unknown readiness and high-risk menu/clarification violations. This specifies the serialization and enforcement boundary; numeric profiles, richer actions and device-specific tuning remain open.

**Initial permissions.** Every restricted-attention mode starts with user-initiated local candidate capture, a bounded acknowledgment, pause/stop/silence, and optional explicitly granted media transport (`pause`, `resume`, `skip`, `rewind`) against one fresh, unambiguous playback target. Capture produces existing evidence/candidate records, including Task proposals; it does not create an admitted Task, Snapshot, Preference or Calendar change. Media transport uses the current integration grant and policy checks; it never authorizes sharing, purchases or broader app access. Richer read-only and short-drafting profiles remain open.

Driving, bicycling and uncertain high-risk contexts additionally prohibit generated drafting, reflective/coaching dialogue, spoken menus and visually dependent review. Permit at most one brief clarification per request; an unresolved target or unanswered clarification leads to capture/deferral without retry prompts. External sends, financial actions, legal commitments, deletion, multi-party communication and scheduling changes are deferred. Neither a capability grant, a generic “yes”, an action-specific spoken confirmation nor a model's `safe_for_mode` claim overrides this envelope. UbU may remain silent or suggest user-selected existing media/rest; it must not repeatedly solicit work or queue review prompts while attention is restricted.

**Controller boundary.** Consented local STT yields evidence, then the harness assembles a purpose-limited `ContextBundle` under §21.3 and requests an interpretation/candidate through §21.2. Include only the permitted current referents, relevant admitted state and scoped playback/context versions needed for that operation. Model confidence, risk estimates and confirmation suggestions are advisory. Deterministic validation checks schema, semantics, current budget, Compartment route, grants, object versions, ambiguity and idempotency before invoking an allowlisted control or creating a review candidate. Recheck immediately before dispatch and speech output; a local processing route alone does not authorize reading private content aloud on a shared audio endpoint. Raw AV stays local under §12.2; an unavailable local backend never creates cloud-fallback authority.

**Initial typed interpretation (`UBU-D0310`).** `AudioInterpretationV1` is the closed JSON result for the initial envelope only. All keys are required; `null` or `unknown` represents an unavailable estimate. References are opaque aliases supplied in this request, not model-authored object identifiers. This is the schema template; the controller instantiates a conservative producer grammar under §21.2. Matching it does not establish permission. Apply the budget's finite response-size cap before parsing one complete JSON object; reject duplicate keys, non-finite numbers and trailing content.

```

Before offering the grammar, the controller constrains `request_id` to the invocation's id, replaces each context/evidence/playback reference site with an enum of supplied aliases, and removes action branches or media operations outside the current envelope and grants. An empty alias set forces the related entity list empty or removes the related action branch; no remaining clarification allowance means the `clarify` branch is unavailable. Uncertain or partial STT permits only clarification or deferral, while the already-authorized evidence may remain unresolved. Static intent/action consistency is encoded in the schema; dynamic semantic and policy checks still run at dispatch.

Semantic validation repeats these constraints and checks current context:

- `capture`, `session_control` and `media_transport` require the matching non-null action kind, empty `ambiguity`, null `clarification_request` and null `defer_reason`. Capture requires `ordinary_review`; session and media controls require `none`. These labels never perform admission or confirmation.
- `clarify` requires a non-null `clarification_request`, `required_confirmation = clarification`, and null action and defer reason. `defer` requires a non-null defer reason, `ordinary_review`, and null action and clarification request. `no_op` requires null action, clarification request and defer reason, and `none`. Nonempty ambiguity permits only `clarify` or `defer`.
- Entity aliases must occur in the permitted ContextBundle and match their declared role; they suggest associations without resolving Identity or ownership. Capture must cite a supplied STT evidence span belonging to the current utterance. The controller retains that evidence as an existing unresolved candidate; a model cannot supply replacement note text, admit a Task, or invent evidence. `note` routes to existing quick-note/Discovery evidence and `task_candidate` to existing Task proposals; these routing tags do not extend candidate-type or provenance enums.
- Media transport must name the one fresh playback alias whose integration, target and state version the controller bound to this request. `skip` and `rewind` each mean one integration-declared bounded step; requested quantities or other unsupported arguments defer rather than being silently approximated. The result cannot contain arbitrary tool names, destinations, credentials, message payloads or executable code.

**Request binding.** Outside the producer result, the controller binds each invocation to its request id, session, Device, STT evidence/version, ContextBundle, budget and policy versions, scoped grants, playback target/version when applicable, session interaction epoch, finite deadline and idempotency key. The echoed `request_id` must match that invocation's original binding; it cannot select another request. Interruption or a material mode, Device, endpoint, target, payload, policy or grant change invalidates outstanding bindings and advances the epoch. The controller serializes invalidation, result acceptance and dispatch decisions. Late results cannot speak, dispatch or supply a new clarification; a fresh request needs fresh evidence and current context.

The controller rechecks the binding and operation permissions before both speech and dispatch. Confidence, load, risk, confirmation and `safe_for_mode` are advisory; the controller may tighten or defer, never widen the envelope. Load describes the proposed interaction, never the user's intelligence, affect or capacity. A clarification uses a controller-owned bounded template and consumes the request's remaining clarification allowance. Acknowledgments report only confirmed capture/control outcomes; a capture acknowledgment means that a review artifact was retained, without confirming its content. The model result is never spoken directly. Recognized pause/stop/silence controls take an immediate local path without waiting for an LLM; local stop/silence controls remain available if model processing fails.

Reject malformed, truncated, oversized, unknown-version, extra-field, forged-reference or semantically inconsistent results without repairing them into executable actions. Preserve only already-authorized evidence as an unresolved review item, without automatic model retries or repeated prompts. Duplicate results reuse the original idempotency key and are ignored after the first acceptance, including speech and clarification; an uncertain media outcome requires state reconciliation and a fresh user request, never automatic repetition of a relative skip/rewind.

Before enabling v1, include negative fixtures for unknown action kinds, foreign evidence/playback aliases, inconsistent intent/action pairs, late replies after interruption or handoff, and duplicate/unknown media outcomes. Valid capture stays in candidate state; every consequential external request remains deferred under the initial envelope. This specifies a contract, not a shipped schema or implementation. Numeric mode profiles, external-action confirmation grammar and richer output extensions remain in `UBU-Q0128`.

**Interruption and deferral.** Partial/uncertain STT, ambiguous recipients or “this/that” references, stale media state and false conversational continuity never select an action by confidence alone. Ask at most the budgeted clarification count, then retain an unresolved candidate or defer. Interruption cancels unfinished speech and pending confirmation; it cannot complete an utterance or replay an action. A mode, target, payload, policy or Device change invalidates pending approval. Leaving a restricted mode only makes a deferred item available for ordinary review: it never dispatches it. Any later consequential action needs fresh admission under current authority and confirmation bound to the exact operation, recipient, payload/version and expiry; the detailed audio confirmation grammar remains open.

Audit records link the session, evidence/candidate, budget and policy versions, ContextBundle, resolved target/version, policy decision and reason, approval/deferral/rejection, invocation/result and idempotency key. They retain minimized summaries or permitted refs, not a mandatory recording or full transcript. Raw-media retention remains under §12.2 and `UBU-Q0170`–`UBU-Q0171`. Device handoff rechecks capture, context, output route and authority; synchronized candidates never carry live microphone consent or pending execution approval.

**Release boundary.** Before enabling a restricted-attention slice, demonstrate that interruption stops output, uncertain references do not dispatch, high-risk sends remain deferred despite confirmation, mode/Device changes do not execute queued work, and offline operation preserves local-only denials. This is a design contract, not an implementation or a claim of validated driving safety. `UBU-Q0183` retains the delivery sequence and device allocation under `UBU-D0292`; richer media/narration and profile tuning remain later answers, without restoring a Phase 3 gate.

#### 21.1.3 MVP interaction coverage and alternatives

**Product contract (`UBU-D0319`).** Realize `UBU-D0292` through a common planning/review surface: showing a concrete concern and speaking about it produces a reviewable proposal or an explicit unresolved result with a useful next step. A camera preview, transcript or conversation alone does not satisfy delivery. Text and forms are directly reachable before capture or permission requests, without a full inventory or later-phase Resource/Skill/Technique setup.

**Source choice.** Camera, microphone and speech output are independently selectable; opening the surface starts none of them. Before acquisition, disclose purpose, active Identity/Compartment, enabled sources, local route and effective retention limits. Keep capture state, pause/stop, silence and switch-to-text controls available during capture and processing. Permission to use hardware is not session consent. A remembered surface choice is a user-controlled UI setting, not an inferred planner Preference; declining capture must not cause recurring permission prompts. Guided acquisition explains the missing information, offers another view, and allows stop or an alternative.

**Ordinary-attention coverage.** All routes use the same admitted-state operations, validation and review authority; provenance follows the actual source. Camera input is useful where observation is relevant, rather than required for every operation.

| Workflow | Camera/voice route | Text/form route |
|---|---|---|
| First useful concern or quick capture | Show relevant context and describe the concern; propose a note or Task with uncertainty visible. | Type the concern or enter minimal note/Task fields without a media attachment. |
| Clarify or correct | Ask about consequential ambiguity; let the operator identify the target, correct interpretation or leave it unresolved. | Select permitted existing targets and edit exact names, values, dates, durations or constraints; retain unknown/private or unresolved answers without inventing field values. |
| Next action and explanation | Request the next legitimate Task and inspect or hear why it is recommended. | Read the same Task, explanation, constraints and permitted evidence, or the reason no legitimate recommendation is available. |
| Review a proposal | Discuss its source, uncertainty, exact proposed diff and effects; explicitly accept, correct, reject or defer the identified item. | Inspect the same candidate and diff, edit fields, and accept, reject or defer without speaking or capturing media. |
| Act, override and reconcile | Report action, override or progress; observations remain candidates for actual-versus-planned reconciliation. | Use Task controls and interval/status entry, including unknown/private time, under the existing Log, Snapshot and recalculation rules. |
| State a Preference | Speak an explicit pairwise statement and review it before acceptance. | Enter and accept the same pairwise statement; channel choice or repeated behavior creates no planner Preference. |

**Continuity and degradation.** Changing surfaces preserves permitted user-authored drafts and retained candidate/version/evidence links, distinguishes operator corrections from model interpretations, and shows unsaved input. It neither admits a candidate nor duplicates an operation, starts another source, changes Compartment or extends raw-media retention. Changed source/context bindings invalidate pending interpretations and approvals; late results cannot overwrite manual corrections. Missing, declined, revoked, noisy or poorly framed sources and failed or over-budget local backends leave the remaining routes useful. Explain the limitation without claiming recognition and offer text/forms; do not retry capture repeatedly or reroute local AV to cloud processing. With camera and microphone disabled and models unavailable, manual capture/editing, existing Plan inspection, candidate review and action/override recording remain usable through ordinary validation. Forms expose precision on demand without requiring internal-ontology entry; labels, errors, focus and review actions work with keyboard and screen reader, with speech output optional.

**Acceptance evidence.** Before claiming the primary surface delivered, attach revision-pinned scenario results on the real hardware selected by `UBU-Q0183`, identifying enabled sources/backends, policy configuration, outcomes and permitted candidate/admission references. Demonstrate:

- A shown concern plus voice uses a visible detail and permitted context to produce a useful candidate or consequential clarification, followed by operator correction, admission and a legitimate next action or explicit planning limitation. Exercise the other voice workflows and repeat every table row using only text/forms with both capture sources disabled. Equivalent accepted meanings produce matching canonical effects and recalculation, with source-appropriate provenance.
- Camera/microphone absence, denial or revocation; noisy speech or unsuccessful framing; offline/local-model failure and resource exhaustion allow manual completion without lost permitted input, fabricated observations, false saved-state acknowledgments or cloud fallback.
- Keyboard-only and screen-reader completion of text/form entry, exact-value correction and review with speech output disabled; guided acquisition can be stopped or replaced without repeated unexplained capture requests.
- Start, pause, resume, stop and revocation accurately control acquisition and visible state. Raw AV stays local; context and output respect Compartment denials, and export requires its separate authority. Retention behavior matches the approved policy rather than a documentation claim.
- Switching surfaces during a delayed interpretation, duplicate submission/replay, and material context, policy or Device change cause neither stale admission nor duplicate mutations. Preserved candidates carry no live capture consent or pending execution approval across Devices.
- Ambiguous objects, high-confidence interpretations and apparent completion remain unresolved/candidate evidence until required review and validation. Unknown/private intervals and channel choices create no inferred intent, affect, Preference, habit or completion claim. Restricted attention obeys §21.1.2: defer unavailable review rather than demand visual/form interaction or widen permissions.

This resolves interaction coverage and acceptance, not implementation. `UBU-Q0183` retains capture-mode/device allocation and delivery sequence; `UBU-Q0160` retains the mobile workload/API choice; `UBU-Q0128` retains numeric restricted-attention profiles and richer actions; `UBU-Q0166`–`UBU-Q0172` retain exact evidence, corroboration, latency, segmentation and retention contracts. Apply the existing evidence, policy and attention gates to each enabled slice. No particular backend, hardware support, latency target or later-phase planning object is established here.

### 21.2 Structured-output admission pipeline

LLM, parser, worker, and agent outputs should follow an admission pipeline:

```text
output
  -> schema validation
  -> semantic validation
  -> Compartment and policy validation
  -> provenance and confidence attachment
  -> conflict detection
  -> user-review classification
  -> accepted canonical object or rejected candidate
```

This applies to structured message extraction, realtime observations, AssociationAttestations, Tasks, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, and agent outputs.

**Producer grammar rule (`UBU-D0299`).** Every shape offered to a producer must satisfy its unchanged semantic validator for the matching context. An intentional, documented and independently tested conservative subset is allowed; the producer grammar need not equal the full authoring validator. Schema membership is only the first gate, and does not confer canonical truth or authority.

#### 21.2.1 Phase 1b advisory candidate lifecycle

An `AdvisoryCandidate` is the first-class object form for Phase 1b review-queue proposals, including tag, dependency, preference, decomposition, clarification-question, and other advisory outputs before admission. It is `candidate_state`, not admitted state, until an admission decision creates the ordinary canonical mutation or review event.

The minimum record contains `advisory_candidate_id`, `schema_version`, `candidate_kind`, lifecycle state, object version, target or scope refs, normalized proposal shape, payload ref or redacted payload summary, source evidence refs or hashes, confidence, per-field provenance, proposed/effective time or interval, proposing actor or model/tool metadata, origin Device and execution-context provenance, idempotency key, optional suppression key, `compartment_ids`, a review-visible Compartment label or redacted label, disclosure and retention policy, review order metadata, and correction, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, admission, or archive links. Candidates are per-object records rather than aggregate queue blobs so each candidate can be versioned, replicated, redacted, and reviewed under its own Compartment policy.

The normalized proposal shape for a `Decomposition` candidate contains the target Task ref, proposed Container summary or inherited original-intent fields, ordered proposed child Tasks with stable proposed-child keys, titles, duration models, child-specific constraints and provenance, and split markers after child positions. The advisor proposes split markers only at natural pause points or where child-specific hard constraints require a boundary; review may edit child text, durations, constraints, order, and split markers before admission. Until admitted, these proposed segments remain candidate-state preview material and never become hidden planner constraints.

Lifecycle states are `proposed`, `deferred`, `resurfaced`, `admitted`, `rejected`, `superseded`, and `archived`. New candidates start as `proposed`; `proposed` candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred, superseded, or archived. Deferred candidates may become `resurfaced`, rejected, superseded, or archived. Resurfaced candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred again, superseded, or archived. Admitted, rejected, and superseded candidates remain historical records and may later be archived according to retention policy; archiving is not erasure unless a separate redaction or deletion policy permits it.

Unadmitted candidates may influence only review surfaces: ordering, grouping, explanations, deduplication diagnostics, clarification prompts, local suggestions, and explicitly labeled preview diffs. They must not mutate Tasks, tags, dependencies, decompositions, clarification answers, Preferences, Logs, Snapshots, Plans, Calendars, Relationships, Associations, projection state, capability grants, disclosure policy, external messages, or external actions. They must not become hidden planner constraints. Enforcement is by requiring admitted-state reducers, planners, projection writers, and mutation call sites to consume only admitted canonical objects or explicit preview inputs, while candidate reads remain scoped to review APIs that preserve candidate-state labels and Compartment policy.

Deferral preserves an unresolved proposal without treating it as false. A deferred candidate may resurface only on materially new evidence, user request, a policy-triggered review interval, a relevant accepted change to the candidate target or dependencies, or arrival of a clarification or external reference that directly changes reviewability. Resurfacing links the prior deferral, trigger evidence, and reason the old deferral no longer controls; it creates a review item and never admits the candidate automatically.

Rejection is durable correction metadata. A rejected candidate retains a privacy-minimized suppression record containing candidate kind, normalized proposal shape, target and scope shape, Compartment and redaction class, evidence hashes or source fingerprints, extractor/model/schema version, prompt or template digest when relevant, rejection reason or user correction, deciding actor Identity, `authority_source`, decided-at time, retention or purge policy, and the suppression key. The rejected payload may be redacted or purged under retention policy once the suppression record is sufficient; retaining the key must not make the rejected proposal accepted, exportable, more visible, or usable as evidence that the rejected content was true.

Admission, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, and archival decisions are first-class review events carrying actor Identity, `authority_source`, origin Device, observed candidate version, observed policy versions when policy is relied on, effective time, recorded time, idempotency key, and links to resulting canonical mutations or replacement candidates. Admission emits the ordinary sync-ready mutation envelope for the admitted object change; rejection emits the decision event and suppression record without creating the proposed canonical state.

Review order never changes state category. Proposed and resurfaced candidates may be prioritized ahead of deferred or archived records, but a contested region remains `candidate_state` or `pending_state` until an admission or conflict-resolution event is itself admitted. UI, APIs, derived previews, and reports must label candidate diffs as candidate or preview material and must not present them as `admitted_state` merely because they are high priority, old, repeated, or uncontested in the queue.

#### 21.2.2 Implemented precondition and vocabulary advice

`UBU-D0294` records admitted-precondition review: explicit replacement/clear candidates, stale-value checks, finite escalating holds, admission-reset escalation and the blocking-now seed cap. Rejecting a newly proposed precondition instead durably suppresses that proposal for that Task. These are separate dismissal semantics. Later field reviewers inherit the contract; only precondition review is implemented today.

`UBU-D0295` records the local precondition producer's title/optional-description and recorded-target-name inputs, with no fact values/provenance sent. Every leaf names an existing target, including `absent`; the controller validates before enqueue and admission. Precondition and vocabulary proposal producers consider at most 25 Tasks, return at most three proposals, and refuse when ten or more of their own kind are proposed/resurfaced. Deferred candidates do not count; a permitted batch can cross the refusal threshold, which is not a hard queue ceiling. `UBU-D0296` keeps UniverseTarget proposals name-only, with only operator-authored values admitted.

### 21.3 ContextBundle

A `ContextBundle` is a governed package of context assembled for a model, tool, worker, agent, or long-context review. It is the auditable boundary between UbU's explicit state and an execution backend.

Minimum fields:

- `context_bundle_id`;
- `schema_version`;
- `purpose`;
- `requested_operation`;
- `actor_identity_ref`;
- `related_task_refs`, `related_objective_refs`, or workflow refs when applicable;
- `route_request_ref` and `route_decision_ref` when the bundle is used for LLM routing;
- `destination_ref`, including provider/tool/worker, provider class, model or tool ref, and boundary classification;
- `source_refs`;
- `source_selectors`, time ranges, object ranges, or repository paths included;
- `source_snapshot_refs` or hashes sufficient to identify the assembled version;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `compartment_policy_results`;
- `identity_refs_exposed`;
- `association_refs_exposed`;
- `relationship_refs_exposed` when applicable;
- `data_categories_exposed`;
- `sensitivity_summary`;
- `token_or_size_estimate`;
- `redaction_policy`;
- `minimization_rules_applied`;
- `excluded_source_summary`;
- `prompt_injection_exposure_summary` when the bundle includes untrusted external text, webpages, messages, documents, or repository content;
- `retention_policy`;
- `training_or_secondary_use_policy`;
- `user_visible_summary`;
- `approval_state`;
- `approval_log_ref` when approval or denial was recorded;
- `created_at`;
- `expires_at`;
- `invocation_refs`;
- `supports_candidate_refs`;
- `exposure_summary_ref`;
- `log_refs`.

ContextBundles may contain raw payload only when the task requires it and policy allows it. The preferred representation is references, selectors, summaries, hashes, redacted excerpts, or structural fields that let the model perform the requested work without copying unnecessary private material. Repository and archive-scale bundles should record path or object selectors and excluded material, not merely a broad repository or archive name.

Compartment policy is checked before assembly and again before invocation. If any included source is denied for the destination, UbU must either exclude that source and record the exclusion or deny the bundle. A mixed-Compartment bundle inherits the most restrictive applicable route. User approval, capability grants, workflow settings, and provider preferences cannot override `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, `local_only`, or other hard Compartment denials.

User approval is required before routing a ContextBundle when the bundle sends protected payload, low-security un-compartmented content beyond structural references, Relationship evidence, Association evidence, private messages, broad repository or archive content, or other long-context bulk material to a cloud provider, external provider, remote worker, managed gateway, third-party tool, or different Identity/Association boundary. Approval is also required when the provider, model, operator, region, retention/training profile, data categories, minimization policy, or source scope differs materially from an already approved workflow template.

Policy-based approval is allowed only when a prior user-approved rule names the workflow, destination class, allowed Compartments or data categories, maximum source scope, minimization rule, retention profile, cost limits when relevant, expiry, and review requirement. The rule must still fail closed on hard Compartment denials or materially broader context than the rule allowed. Local-only deterministic processing or local model use may proceed without per-run approval when existing local policy permits it and the bundle does not cross a new disclosure boundary.

After invocation, UbU should create or update a context exposure summary. The summary records the actual provider/model/tool used, invocation refs, source counts and categories, Compartments, Identities, Associations, and Relationships exposed, raw-versus-summary/reference volume, redactions and exclusions, retention/training profile, prompt-injection exposure notes, approval and routing Log refs, downstream candidate refs, and any denied or omitted context that affected output quality. The summary is a review artifact and must not contain secrets or unnecessary raw payload.

ContextBundles are immutable after use. Corrections, narrower reruns, broader reruns, or provider changes create a new bundle or a superseding revision linked by Log entries. Candidate updates, AssociationAttestations, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, worker mutation requests, and other downstream outputs must carry `originating_context_bundle_refs` or equivalent provenance. Logs for approval, denial, invocation, output admission, and rejection should link back to the relevant ContextBundle.

### 21.4 MCP-style client and server boundary

UbU as an MCP-style client may call external tools and services. UbU as an MCP-style server may expose narrow tool surfaces to external agents.

Phase 1 server tools are query or candidate-submission tools only:

- `plan_summary.read`;
- `objective_status.query`;
- `task_candidate.create`;
- `log_candidate.submit`;
- `plan_repair.submit`;
- `clarification.request`;
- `delegation_packet.prepare`;
- `projection_preview.submit`;
- `association_attestation_candidate.submit` for fixtures or manually reviewed Association-introspection dogfooding.

Phase 1 server tools do not directly create, update, or delete canonical Objectives, Tasks, Logs, UniverseState, External References, Plans, Calendars, projection state, credentials, or external systems. Any write-like request becomes a candidate, worker-style mutation request, projection request, clarification request, or review artifact admitted by the canonical instance.

A minimum `MCPToolCapabilityGrant` includes grant ID, issuing parent instance, actor Identity, integration or agent identity, allowed tool names, operation kinds, payload schema refs, object refs or object-type scopes, Objective subtree refs, Task set or Container refs, Compartment constraints, Identity/Association disclosure constraints when applicable, integration or destination refs, time window or expiration, rate and cost limits, review requirement, idempotency/version requirement, audit policy, lifecycle status, and revocation refs. Compartment policy is a hard upper bound; a tool grant cannot override `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed-integration, allowed-device, identity-isolation, or EvidenceUsePolicy denials.

Every external-agent write-like tool call uses a candidate envelope with tool call ID, capability grant ref, actor Identity, target refs, operation, payload, expected prior version when applicable, idempotency key, provenance, evidence refs, originating ContextBundle refs when any, Compartment policy result, confidence when relevant, and review requirement. The canonical instance validates schema, semantics, authority, Compartment policy, idempotency, expected version, assignment or workflow status, and review policy before applying, rejecting, or leaving the candidate pending.

Tool invocations that reach UbU are logged as append-only audit records with redacted argument summary or hash, policy decision, source and destination Identity, Compartment result, cost and rate counters when relevant, result refs, denial or failure reason when safe, and downstream candidate refs. Denied calls fail closed. Retries require the same idempotency key or an explicit superseding request. Rollback is append-only repair through compensating mutation, Log correction, supersession, Task moot transition, projection repair, or AgentAction mitigation metadata; prior invocation and candidate records are not rewritten.

The minimum dogfooding fixture is a local loopback MCP adapter over synthetic or redacted UbU project data. It exposes the Phase 1 server tools, exercises capability grants and Compartment denials, writes only candidate/review artifacts and audit Logs, and supports a dry-run client path for calling external tools without live external mutation.

### 21.5 Delegation Substrate

A Delegation Substrate packet prepares a Task for execution by making the work explicit enough to hand off, automate, review, or perform oneself with less ambiguity.

Provisional fields:

- `delegation_packet_id`;
- `task_ref` or `objective_ref`;
- `purpose`;
- `executor_type` (`self`, `local_agent`, `remote_agent`, `tool`, `human_identity`, `association`, `general_contractor`, `external_provider`);
- `executor_ref` when known;
- `authority_source`;
- `authority_scope`;
- `expected_output`;
- `required_evidence`;
- `review_requirement`;
- `privacy_scope`;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `allowed_tools`;
- `timebox_or_deadline`;
- `failure_path`;
- `escalation_path`;
- `status`.

Status values may include `not_delegated`, `prepared`, `proposed`, `offered`, `accepted`, `in_progress`, `delivered`, `reviewed`, `rejected`, `completed`, and `cancelled`.

When `executor_type` is `self`, the packet acts as a self-reminder and execution aid. It does not imply external handoff.

### 21.6 General Contractor

A General Contractor coordinates multiple subordinate executors to satisfy an Objective or complete a Container of Tasks.

A General Contractor may be a human Identity, agent, or Association. The role may decompose work, assign subtasks, monitor status, request evidence, and submit candidate updates, but only within explicit authority and Compartment bounds.

Open details include subdelegation, authority propagation, budget constraints, evidence requirements, review rights, and failure/escalation semantics.

### 21.7 Skill Barter marketplace direction

The Skill Barter marketplace is a future specialization of Association coordination, Delegation Substrate, Resource/Skill readiness, and Technique evidence. It is not a Phase 1 public marketplace.

The private Skill model should come first. A user must be able to model, learn, test, refresh, and use Skills for their own life logistics before UbU exposes those Skills to other Identities. Once private skill evidence and Delegation Substrate packets are useful, Skill Barter can become a voluntary exchange layer rather than a generic labor marketplace.

A mature Skill Barter system may support privacy-preserving skilled-work exchange, pseudonymous capability claims, reputation without unnecessary doxxing, scoped work agreements, private or selective-disclosure evidence, lawful user-controlled settlement references, dispute workflows, and human/agentic executor discovery.

For EthConf and cypherpunk outreach, Skill Barter is useful as a future-direction signal: UbU can preserve cryptocurrency-native values of voluntary coordination, sovereign identity, privacy, FOSS development, open markets, economic self-sufficiency, and lifelong skill acquisition without becoming token-first or speculation-first.

The preferred framing is an open, user-sovereign skill economy or a self-reinforcing ecosystem for skill acquisition, task execution, and voluntary exchange. Avoid calling it a closed ecosystem, because that implies platform captivity rather than user sovereignty.

### 21.8 AgentAction and BackgroundProcess

An `AgentAction` is one bounded attempted action by an agent, model, worker, or tool against an external or privileged surface. A `BackgroundProcess` is the durable controller object that decides when zero or more `AgentAction`s should be proposed, run, retried, cancelled, or escalated without necessarily occupying user Calendar time.

`AgentAction` fields describe a single dispatch or candidate dispatch:

- `agent_action_id`;
- optional `background_process_ref`;
- `actor_identity_ref` and `agent_or_tool_ref`;
- purpose, related Objective/Task/workflow refs, and originating ContextBundle refs;
- target surface, operation kind, payload summary or hash, expected prior external version, and idempotency key;
- authority source, capability grant refs, credential or secret-capability refs by opaque handle and version, Compartment refs, Identity/Association disclosure constraints, and provider/tool route decision refs;
- prompt-injection exposure assessment and containment policy;
- compute, rate, money, and privacy-budget estimate plus actual usage when known;
- side-effect class, reversibility, dry-run/candidate status, review requirement, and approval state;
- result status, external result refs, downstream candidate refs, completion evidence, Log refs, and failure or denial reason when safe;
- rollback or mitigation metadata for any external effect that cannot simply be ignored.

`BackgroundProcess` fields describe standing permission and scheduling policy:

- `background_process_id`, owner Identity, purpose, lifecycle status, created/updated/disabled refs, and policy version;
- trigger spec, recurrence or polling rule, event subscriptions, manual-start affordance, run window, deadline when any, expiry, concurrency limit, retry and backoff policy, cancellation policy, and maximum catch-up behavior after downtime;
- allowed action kinds, target surfaces, provider/tool classes, capability grants, credential handles, Compartments, and ContextBundle templates;
- compute, rate, money, and privacy-budget caps per action, per period, and lifetime;
- prompt-injection risk ceiling, required isolation mode, review threshold, output-admission policy, and candidate-update policy;
- notification policy, quiet-hours behavior, escalation path, failure threshold, and required user-visible summary;
- Calendar projection policy, audit/logging policy, retained evidence refs, and cleanup or mitigation obligations.

**Phase 1b advisory batch runner (`UBU-D0264`).** The minimum Phase 1b advisory batch runner is a narrow `BackgroundProcess` whose allowed action kind is local advisory candidate generation through the `LocalAdvisorySubmission`/`LocalAdvisoryResult` boundary. Its durable process record contains `background_process_id`, owner Identity, purpose, lifecycle status, operation kind, eligibility filter, interval or manual-start policy, run window, concurrency limit of one unless explicitly raised, per-run and per-object pass caps, retry/backoff and cancellation policy, maximum catch-up behavior, `WorkerAuthority` ref, secret-capability refs by id and version, Compartment and ContextBundle template refs, compute/rate/money/privacy caps, prompt-injection ceiling, output-admission policy, notification/escalation policy, Calendar projection policy of `none` by default, audit policy, and retained evidence refs. Dispatch rechecks lifecycle, eligibility, object versions, Compartment policy, credential version, capability grants, budgets, and prompt-injection ceiling immediately before each object attempt.

Per-object progress is canonical process state, not a single aggregate blob. A `BackgroundProcessObjectState` is keyed by background process, target object ref, operation kind, and policy or prompt/template version when that version affects eligibility. It records lifecycle status, observed object version, eligibility reason, pass count, success and failure counts, last attempted/succeeded/failed times, last result status, next eligible time, last `AgentAction`/worker-result refs, candidate refs when any, and safe diagnostic refs. Updating this state uses ordinary mutation-envelope/idempotency rules so later sync can version and replicate each object's progress independently.

Run control is event-sourced. Each run records append-only audit events such as `background_process_run_started`, `object_attempt_started`, `object_attempt_succeeded`, `object_attempt_failed`, `run_interrupted`, `run_resumed`, `run_cancelled`, and `run_completed`, with checkpoint cursor, object counts, budget use, interruption reason, actor or signal source when safe, and Log refs. Resumption reads durable object state and the last run event; in-memory cursors are only caches. A graceful interrupt records the checkpoint before exit, and retry uses the same per-object idempotency keys rather than reprocessing successful objects.

The Phase 1b advisory process creates candidate artifacts only; it does not occupy Calendar time merely because it consumes compute, credentials, or wall-clock duration. Operator surfaces show elapsed time, compute/resource use, credential/capability versions used, candidate counts, per-object pass counts, failure counts, and last-run status in process state or summaries. Calendar entries are created only for user attention, review deadlines, reminders, or escalation Tasks, not for the unattended compute itself.

A batch over operator-authored lore plus external message content is never below `medium` prompt-injection exposure. It is `high` whenever untrusted external text is mixed with private context, can influence candidate content materially, or could affect tool choice, routing, credential use, or arguments without containment. Phase 1b containment is source separation, instruction stripping or quoting for untrusted text, narrowed ContextBundles, allowlisted no-network local advisory calls, candidate-only writes, credential brokering by the controller, result schema validation, and human review for admitted state. `Critical` exposure fails closed; Phase 1b does not permit advisory batch content to drive external mutation, spending, credential disclosure, or policy expansion.

Default notification is summary-only for a clean run that creates candidates or for a clean no-op with no eligible work. The process must notify or escalate when dispatch is denied by policy or credential state, the run fails, every attempted object fails, malformed results dominate the run, budgets are exhausted, prompt-injection exposure exceeds the ceiling, or a configured no-output threshold is reached. For shutdown chaining, exit success means only that the process reached a terminal clean state: `completed`, `completed_no_eligible_work`, or `completed_no_candidate_output` with no escalation-required failures. A run that attempted eligible objects and all failed, was interrupted before checkpoint, exceeded policy, or ended with unknown result exits nonzero and records escalation; power-off automation must not treat that as successful work completion.

Prompt-injection exposure is scored before dispatch and updated after execution. The score combines source trust, whether the agent consumed untrusted webpages, messages, documents, tool outputs, or mixed-Compartment content, the amount of raw private context exposed, whether untrusted text can influence tool choice or arguments, and the authority at risk: credentials, spending, external mutation, privacy export, or user-facing commitments. The minimum qualitative bands are `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `critical`. `High` exposure requires containment such as instruction stripping, source separation, allowlisted tools, candidate-only writes, narrowed ContextBundles, or human review. `Critical` exposure fails closed unless a specific approved policy permits the run and the action remains inside hard Compartment, credential, cost, and review gates.

External side effects carry a side-effect class: `read_only`, `local_candidate_only`, `externally_reversible`, `compensating_action_possible`, `externally_irreversible`, or `unknown`. Anything outside `read_only` or `local_candidate_only` must record expected external prior state when available, idempotency keys, evidence to reconcile the result, and the review gate that admitted the effect. `Compensating_action_possible`, `externally_irreversible`, and `unknown` actions require mitigation metadata before dispatch: mitigation owner, user notification rule, cancellation or revocation path, compensating operation when one exists, external support/contact path when relevant, deadline for mitigation, and the Log or candidate records that should be written if mitigation is needed.

Background processes are Calendar items only when they reserve or require the user's attention, represent a user commitment to another party, or make the user's availability materially unavailable. Compute-only work, polling, sync, advisory analysis, candidate generation, projection reconciliation, and scheduled external checks remain separate process state. They may surface Calendar overlays, deadlines, reminders, or review Tasks, but those projections do not become user time blocks unless the user must attend, decide, travel, meet, or be unavailable.

All AgentAction and BackgroundProcess mutations remain candidate/admission workflows unless an accepted integration policy gives narrower automatic authority. Dispatch rechecks current Compartment policy, credential version, capability grant, budget, lifecycle status, and expected external version immediately before use. Logs are append-only: failed, denied, cancelled, mitigated, and superseded actions are recorded rather than rewritten.

### 21.9 State-transition cockpit

The long-term UX should present the current state transition and its evidence, constraints, expected effects, authority, privacy scope, and available actions.

Phase 1 proves this through one recommended next Task and an inspectable explanation. Later cockpit surfaces may include message triage, Log review, Plan repair, Delegation Substrate packets, agent approvals, AssociationAttestation review, organizational introspection, and projection publication.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

For Phase 2, a single-live-session sync implementation is sufficient (`UBU-D0312`), with arbitrary N Devices, concurrent offline mutations, partial replicas, and transport-independent integrity-protected statements. Direct exchanges, imported bundles, and user-selected encrypted stores share the same causality, policy, and conflict rules; no Device or transport becomes a permanent canonical authority. Full automatic peer mesh is optional. DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §26's topology research remains a freeze gate, with at least three Devices demonstrating serialized direct exchange and encrypted store-and-forward, recoverable delivery, deterministic admission/conflict handling, and Compartment-safe partial replication as specified by `UBU-D0312`.

The minimum indirect path for the first Phase 2 sync release is implemented, authenticated encrypted bundle export/import through a user-selected file store, with at least one documented external rclone or rsync copy workflow exercised before freeze (`UBU-D0313`). Manual export/copy/import is sufficient; built-in clients and background delivery are optional. Encryption and recipient authorization protect statements, payloads, and manifests before storage, while ordinary admission and Compartment policy govern every import.

**Interrupted sync recovery (`UBU-D0314`).** Maintain a durable, policy-protected recovery record throughout each exchange. Connection loss, interrupted import, or restart without an admitted final checkpoint for the declared exchange scope records `incomplete_sync_session`. End the failed live session and release its slot while preserving recovery records and queued work; other Devices may synchronize and ordinary policy-authorized offline work may continue against an explicitly stale local view.

Fully verified, authorized statements whose required causal/admission dependencies are satisfied may be admitted incrementally. Persist each admission outcome, resulting state, and deduplication metadata as one crash-consistent unit. These admissions survive disconnect, retry, and discard, subject to existing redaction/purge policy. Partial statements, unverified payloads, and items with missing required statements or dependencies remain staged; they cannot be treated as admitted mutations or supply authoritative inputs to Plans or external projections.

An integrity-protected `checkpoint` or equivalent authenticated manifest commit must bind the declared exchange scope and expected statement/payload inventory, or its content-addressed equivalent. Admit it only after all material required for this Replica's authorized replication level has been durably verified and the required dependency/admission checks have completed. Report completion only after that checkpoint admission is durable, and only for that local scope. A checkpoint cannot admit contested mutations or prove other Devices current. A lost acknowledgment leaves delivery unknown to the sender; replay cannot undo the recipient's durable admissions. Outgoing statements remain pending for an intended recipient until the sender durably records a matching authenticated acknowledgment of that recipient's durable checkpoint admission. Exchange acknowledgments directly or through encrypted return bundles; transmission, file-copy success, or local checkpoint creation is insufficient.

The recovery record tracks exchange/bundle identity, source/recipient Device references, authenticated manifest reference if available, last locally admitted checkpoint, received/missing content references, and durable per-statement admission/idempotency outcomes. Reconstruct progress after restart from durable records. Recovery storage, dependency fetches, retention, and diagnostics obey current Zone/Compartment policy; restricted views reveal neither denied payload nor Compartment identity. Retention cleanup preserves permitted causality, deduplication, and incomplete/discard outcome metadata; missing content must be retransmitted rather than assumed received.

At the next authorized connection or import, resume from durable progress, or replay the original statements if no usable cursor exists. Preserve original statement ids, content hashes, idempotency keys, causal parents, and observed versions. Recheck integrity, Device trust, actor authority, current routing/Compartment policy, object/policy versions, and dependencies before admitting pending material or disclosing retained content. Recovery records and old checkpoints grant no authority. Automatic recovery is allowed only for deterministic, idempotent, non-authority-changing cases under `UBU-D0248`; revoked Devices and review-required conflicts retain their ordinary rejection/review rules.

Offer Resume/retry and Discard through the existing policy-safe incomplete/stale-sync diagnostic, showing the last completed scope and permitted pending counts. Discard removes unfinished incoming staging and its cursor while preserving already-admitted history, locally authored queued work, and still-required policy-permitted causality/idempotency metadata; record the discard outcome. It does not emit a tombstone or undo admitted mutations. A transient interruption alone requires no blocking merge prompt. Review-required conflicts use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §17's blocking `manual_decision` diagnostic and admitted `conflict_resolution` statement. Apply DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §22's Plan invalidation/recalculation rules to admitted changes even while the exchange remains incomplete.

**Sync-state warnings (`UBU-D0315`).** Multiple Devices may remain powered on and perform policy-authorized offline work simultaneously; only live sync exchanges serialize under `UBU-D0312`. Explain this once in Phase 2 onboarding. Ordinary offline use, Device switching, peer absence, and elapsed time alone cause no modal warning or recurring notification. Time-based reminders are opt-in with a user-selected cadence.

Keep one compact, non-blocking status for the active permitted sync scope, with details on demand: last durably admitted checkpoint and its scope/time (or "No completed exchange yet"), permitted locally authored pending counts split into awaiting exchange and awaiting recipient acknowledgment, staged incoming work, and incomplete-session state with Resume/retry and Discard per `UBU-D0314`. Say "Delivery unconfirmed" for a missing acknowledgment. File-copy success and a completed local exchange never justify "All Devices are up to date". A disconnected peer's changes are unknown unless policy-permitted evidence establishes pending state; age alone proves neither new changes nor their absence.

Show an inline Plan/Calendar freshness explanation where relevant inputs may be missing or stale: "This Plan uses this Device's current view; other Devices may have changes." Identify confirmed remote pending changes only when supported by permitted evidence. Locally authored outgoing work is saved local state, not evidence that the local Plan is stale. Label protected blocks and policy-withheld items separately from exchange failures; retrying sync cannot expand visibility.

Before external projection whose relevant permitted inputs have known pending changes, an incomplete exchange, or unknown peer freshness, present an inline review: "Other Device changes may be missing. Synchronize before projection, or use this Device's current view." Offer Sync/exchange (including export/import), Continue with current view, and Cancel. Continue requires explicit stale-state acceptance once per projection operation or reviewed batch, bound to the Device, operation, payload/input and policy versions, and permitted scope. Record it under §17.0 using `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind: safeguard_advisory_bypassed`; recheck the bindings before execution. This accepts freshness uncertainty only. Current authority, Device trust, integrity, Compartment/export policy, Plan-legitimacy requirements, and `UBU-D0248`'s blocking `manual_decision`/`conflict_resolution` rules still govern eligibility. If those rules forbid execution, omit Continue. Mere interruption or missing peer contact creates no blocking merge prompt.

Coalesce advisory explanations by Device, permitted scope, condition, and material evidence. Offer Dismiss until material change or Snooze until a user-selected time; persist the local choice across views and restart while keeping status discoverable. Reopen for material changes affecting that warning, such as newly learned permitted pending statements or changed relevant Plan/input versions; snooze may also reopen at its chosen deadline. A new projection operation needs its own scoped choice. Age or restart alone cannot reopen a dismissed advisory; opt-in reminders may follow their chosen cadence. Dismissal needs no justification and is logged under §17.0 without turning the warning into a synchronized Task. Advisory suppression cannot hide a required blocking conflict diagnostic.

Generate visible text, counts, urgency, and reappearance only from evidence or derived warnings allowed at this Replica's replication level. Restricted notices use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §23's "A protected object cannot sync to this Device." without denied payload, source object identifiers, or Compartment ids/labels; omit object-specific notices when even existence is denied. Warnings preserve intentional partial replication and never recommend powering off other Devices or switching to a single primary Device.

**Future schedulable manual review (`UBU-D0316`).** A later versioned extension may admit a shared Dynamic review Task with independent, coherent scheduling inputs and a protected conflict-episode identity. Its target is evidence to review, not admitted contested effects. Place it only in validated unaffected Calendar capacity; otherwise keep it unplaced. The diagnostic/prompt must still admit a permitted source-conflict `conflict_resolution` without review Task creation, placement, or completion. Conflicts in the Task, its scheduling/projection artifacts, or resolution workflow terminate at that diagnostic and never spawn review-of-review Tasks. Task lifecycle reconciliation follows resolution; snooze or deletion cannot clear the underlying blocker. Current authority and source privacy govern every step. The first Phase 2 sync release retains §17's diagnostic-only model until this extension's versioned contracts and behavioral gates pass.

**Task lore after Clarify (`UBU-D0317`).** After a Clarify round, persist the operator's submitted answers through ordinary admission independently of synthesis, then offer one additional local synthesis job. The Task description is readable narrative. Keep the pre-existing description, subsequent operator edits, exact questions/answers and their necessary context as separate durable per-Task source records with stable ids, versions, actor/Device/session/round provenance, effective/recorded times, hashes and privacy/retention policy. Versioned context refs are sufficient only while the referenced context remains retrievable. Corrections append records with explicit supersession links; they never edit originals. Accepted model prose is a derived revision, not independent evidence. Raw audio/video retention is not required.

The local model returns an `AdvisoryCandidate` containing proposed prose, model/template provenance, the complete source manifest/digest and a source-to-prose coverage map. Every answer, qualification, original lore statement, correction and unresolved issue must map to prose spans; every factual prose assertion must map back to sources. Equivalent repetitions may share wording. Superseded assertions retain a temporal account of the old and corrected meanings; disagreements, unknowns, declined answers and open questions remain explicit. Preserve attribution, negation, conditions, quantities and uncertainty. Unsupported inferences remain separate labelled suggestions, not synthesized lore.

Review shows the description diff and a source-by-source checklist with exact source text beside its mapped prose. Deterministic checks require complete source/span coverage, valid references, finite bounds and current bindings; structural coverage and another model's opinion cannot establish semantic fidelity. Explicit operator approval confirms readable prose preserves all source meanings and invents no facts or agreement. Offer edit, regenerate or keep the prior description; edited prose needs renewed coverage review. Recheck authority, policy, Task-description/source/candidate versions and source digest before atomically admitting the description revision and its provenance. Concurrent changes invalidate approval and use ordinary conflict review. Failure, rejection or model unavailability preserves the prior description and saved answers. Lore approval does not admit typed planner constraints or authorize external action.

Later Clarify uses admitted prose plus the source manifest, unresolved issues and correction links. Supply exact question/context/answer records for topics being revisited and make remaining permitted originals retrievable. Check the originals before treating a topic as settled; absence from a prompt is not absence of knowledge. Missing records make context explicitly incomplete. A partial Replica unable to establish the full source frontier may offer a scoped preview but cannot replace the Task description.

Declare finite storage, prompt, result and job time/call limits. Retain source history and admitted revision/provenance while the Task is retained; archival must remain queryable. Chunk long inputs along complete source records and track coverage across chunks through the final prose. If complete reviewable prose cannot fit, stop and keep saved sources rather than truncate or drop knowledge; no cloud fallback. At storage exhaustion, pause Clarify and show any unsaved input; never claim it saved or silently evict history. Rejected candidate payloads follow the ordinary minimized retention lifecycle.

Source records, synthesized prose, coverage maps and subsequent context inherit all source disclosure, routing and retention restrictions; local processing does not waive them. Reject synthesis into a Task whose destination policy cannot protect its sources. Recheck policy on every read, sync and export. Authorized redaction/purge also removes disallowed content from dependent prose, revisions and cached context; prevent reconstruction from retained derivatives. Keep only permitted minimized gap metadata, disclose incompleteness without revealing denied existence, and never claim lossless retention beyond that scope.

**Recurring-busy workaround retirement (`UBU-D0318`).** Timed expanded recurrence instances already capture as individual Tasks. Retire a temporary manual capacity blocker only for an operator-reviewed source/series and planning scope with verified replacement occupancy. Full series-level import is not a prerequisite when expanded instances cover that scope; unsupported inputs, missed/on-demand capture and incomplete coverage retain explicit residual blocking.

Record a policy-permitted coverage manifest binding the implementation revision, source/series references, capture window/cursor and completeness evidence, source and admitted input versions, planning horizon, expected busy UTC intervals, occurrence-to-Task lineage, and blocker references. Every relevant busy occurrence must map to one active capacity-bearing representation; record how any uncovered part of the blocker remains protected. Titles or coincident times do not establish occurrence identity. Repeated capture, restart and replay preserve lineage without duplicate Tasks. Moves, cancellations and series changes supersede prior active reservations through ordinary admission while preserving logged history; absence from an incomplete response cannot establish cancellation.

Fixed busy commitments use capacity-occupying Static Tasks at validated UTC start/end times and bound chunks under `UBU-D0279`. Capture counts, Calendar display and Task existence alone do not prove occupancy. Verify the CPU reference path and each enabled planner backend against expected occupied/free intervals: flexible placements cannot enter busy time, and a source occurrence, its projection and its temporary blocker cannot consume capacity twice. Distinct commitments that genuinely overlap retain their conflict rather than being deduplicated by time.

Before removal, show the exact blocker replacements and residual intervals and obtain explicit operator approval bound to the manifest and current versions. Apply them through ordinary admission as one batch, or an equivalent serialized handoff that prevents Plan certification/projection of intermediate missing or doubled occupancy. Invalidate affected Plans and certify recalculation before reuse or projection. Failure or stale inputs preserve protection and require fresh review. Retire only the identified workaround, preserving source commitments and history. Advancing the horizon or receiving material source changes requires renewed coverage checks before using affected capacity; missing, stale or policy-withheld data never proves free time. Evidence and diagnostics obey current Compartment policy; this process neither grants capture/export authority nor bypasses existing sync/projection checks.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.

## Requirements

- Return exactly one JSON object.
- Do not include hidden reasoning, `<think>` tags, markdown fences, or explanatory text outside the JSON object.
- All fields are required.
- Arrays may be empty.
- The patch must be a full git-diff-style patch.
- The patch may modify only:
  - `DESIGN.md`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
  - `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`
  - `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`
- Do not modify `README.md`, `OUTREACH.md`, hidden files, scripts, code files, or generated logs.
- Preserve the single-line metadata format in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.
- Allowed values for `Status:` are `Archived`, `Decomposed`, `Deferred`, `Open`, `Solved`, `Superseded`.
- When resolving a question, set its metadata to `Status: Solved` and set `Resolved by:` to the resolving decision id(s).
- Never write `Status: Resolved`; `Resolved by:` is a separate metadata field.
- The `patch` string must be a raw unified diff as produced by `git diff`; do not wrap it in markdown fences or prose.
- Every file diff must start with `diff --git a/<path> b/<path>`, followed by `--- a/<path>` and `+++ b/<path>`.
- Every hunk must include accurate `@@ -old_start,old_count +new_start,new_count @@` ranges and enough unchanged context for `git apply --check` to apply without `--recount`.
- When editing `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, anchor hunks with the selected question heading `## UBU-Q0128: Embodied Audio Interaction` and its own `### Resolution` section. Do not use a repeated `### Resolution` heading from an earlier or later question as the edit location.
- If resolving the selected question, replace the `Unresolved.` text under that selected question's `### Resolution` section and update that same question's metadata line. Do not insert selected-question resolution text into any other question block.
- Use the existing `UBU-Qxxxx` and `UBU-Dxxxx` numbering conventions.
- Prefer minimal, auditable changesets.
- If the selected question is blocked, propose decomposition only if it produces replacement questions with fewer, simpler, or no dependencies.
- If the selected question is already partially resolved, narrow or clarify it rather than pretending it is fully unresolved.

Return only JSON.
