## UBU-Q0131: Phase 1b Device and execution-context identity

Status: Open Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1b Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0148 Blocks: Phase 1b origin-Device attribution, Phase 2 Device registry Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-09-16 Scored from commit: None

### Question

What is a Device in Phase 1b, and how are physical devices, UbU Devices, and execution contexts distinguished so that origin-Device attribution on every mutation is stable and meaningful with a single operator on a single machine?

### Subquestions

1. Is a Phase 1b Device a persisted canonical object, a configuration record, or a derived identity?
2. Are the desktop instance, the CLI process, the unattended batch runner, and the advisory worker one Device or several execution contexts under one Device?
3. What Device identifier remains stable across reinstallation, database reset, and re-authorization of external integrations?
4. Does the Google Calendar surface count as a Device, an external projection surface, or neither?
5. What minimum Device registry must exist in Phase 1b, given that a registry of one must not encode assumptions that break at two or many?

### Current direction

Phase 1b has one Device but must attribute every mutation to it explicitly, because canonical state is derived from valid statements rather than from machine hierarchy and no Device is automatically the canonical source of all state. The Quick UbU assumption that the desktop is authoritative and the phone is a command-only client was a correct single-machine simplification and must not be re-encoded as an invariant. The Google Calendar surface is a projection, not a Device. Any Phase 1b answer must avoid a design that only works for one or two Devices.

### Resolution

Open.

## Canonical design context

The excerpts below are **not** the whole canonical files. They are the subset selected by
following references from the selected question: its dependencies, the decisions those
questions cite, and the sections those cite in turn.

Read them under these rules:

- **Absence is not non-existence.** Ids and sections you cannot see here still exist.
  Never conclude that a question is unasked, a decision unmade, or a section absent
  because it is not shown.
- **Do not renumber or reuse ids.** Allocate new entries from the next free ids below.
- **Patch context must match the real file.** Hunks are applied against the full files,
  not against these excerpts, and `git apply` locates them by surrounding context. Quote
  surrounding lines exactly as they appear here.
- **Scope your edits to what you can see.** Do not delete or rewrite text on the
  assumption that it duplicates something outside these excerpts.

Next free ids — use these for anything you add:

- next question id: `UBU-Q0151`
- next decision id: `UBU-D0257`

`DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` is read-only context and is not in the patch

## UBU-Q0148: Distinguishing physical devices, UbU Devices, installs, and workers

Status: Solved Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1b Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 100 Depends on: None Blocks: UBU-Q0131, Phase 2 Device registry Resolved by: UBU-D0251 Last scored: 2026-09-16 Scored from commit: None

Formerly UBU-QSYNC-010 (retired from DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md section 28). Defining context: DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4, §5.

### Question

How should UbU distinguish physical devices, UbU Devices/execution enclaves, app installs, browser
sessions, and worker processes? Can one physical machine host multiple UbU Devices/enclaves, and
under what Identity/Compartment conditions?

### Resolution

Resolved by `UBU-D0251`: UbU Device identity is per registered execution enclave, not per physical machine, install, browser session, or process. Those substrates become separate UbU Devices only when intentionally admitted with their own `device_id`, trust state, capability profile, Zone membership, authorized Identity association, and effective Compartment access. One physical machine may host multiple Devices when isolation, Identity authority, and Compartment policy support treating each enclave independently. Projection-only app installs or browser sessions are not Devices, and workers are Devices only when they hold independent policy-scoped execution authority.

```markdown
## UBU-D0251: Device identity is per execution enclave, not per physical machine

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.1. Resolves `UBU-Q0148`.

A UbU Device is a registered execution enclave. A physical machine, app install, browser session, or worker process is not automatically a Device; it is a substrate or runtime context until UbU admits it as a separately identifiable enclave with its own `device_id`, trust state, capability profile, Zone membership, and effective Compartment access.

One physical machine may host multiple UbU Devices when each enclave is intentionally registered, has isolation appropriate to its claimed trust and capabilities, is associated with an authorized Identity, belongs to exactly one Zone, and receives only policy-authorized Compartment knowledge and payload access. Separate OS profiles, containers, VMs, secure enclaves, browser profiles, removable-import environments, and worker runtimes may therefore be separate Devices.

An app install or browser session that only presents another Device's state is a projection surface or execution context, not a Device. A worker process is a Device only when it holds independent execution authority and participates under Device policy; otherwise it is a child process of the controlling Device. Worker candidate mutations still require normal admission and cannot expand Identity, Zone, or Compartment authority.

#### DESIGN.md §23.1 — Device

```markdown
### 23.1 Device

A **Device** is an execution enclave, not necessarily physical hardware. A physical machine, app install, browser session, and worker process are substrates or runtime contexts; they become UbU Devices only when admitted as separately identifiable execution enclaves with their own `device_id`, trust state, capability profile, Zone membership, and effective Compartment access.

Examples:

- OS user profile
- container
- VM
- secure enclave
- browser profile or session
- worker process or worker runtime

One physical machine may host multiple Devices when each enclave is intentionally registered, isolated enough for its trust and capability claims, associated with an authorized Identity, assigned to exactly one Zone, and granted only the Compartments it is allowed to know about. App installs and browser sessions that merely render or project another Device's state are projection surfaces or execution contexts, not Devices. Workers are Devices only when they hold independent execution authority under policy; otherwise they are child processes of the controlling Device.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §5 — Device model **(net-new)**

```markdown
## 5. Device model **(net-new)**

ID and ref naming follows the existing schema convention: identities are `*_id`,
references to objects are `*_ref` / `*_refs`. Compartment permissions reuse the
`compartment_ids` noun rather than an invented `allowlist`/`denylist` term.

```json
{
  "device_id": "dev_laptop_001",
  "device_label": "Sean's Laptop",
  "device_kind": "laptop",
  "registered_at": "2026-06-01T10:00:00-04:00",
  "registered_by_identity_id": "identity_user_main",
  "trust_state": "trusted",
  "sync_state": "active",
  "zone_memberships": ["zone_personal", "zone_ubu_project"],

    "can_store_partial_state": true,
    "can_run_planner": true,
    "can_run_worker_jobs": true,
    "can_hold_external_tokens": true,
    "can_receive_notifications": true,
    "can_use_cloud_llm": false
  },
  "effective_compartment_access": [
    {
      "compartment_id": "comp_public",
      "max_replication_level": "full",
      "offline_cache_allowed": true,
      "worker_access_allowed": true,
      "diagnostic_visibility": "full"
    },
    {
      "compartment_id": "comp_personal",
      "max_replication_level": "metadata_only",
      "offline_cache_allowed": false,
      "worker_access_allowed": false,
      "diagnostic_visibility": "generic_only"
    }
  ],
  "last_seen_at": "2026-06-01T12:00:00-04:00"
}
```

`effective_compartment_access` is an illustrative cached/effective policy summary, not
the complete source of authority. Final replication eligibility is still evaluated from
the object, Zone, Compartment policy, Device capability profile, policy versions, and
user policy updates.

**A Device's effective-access summary enumerates only Compartments the Device is
authorized to know about.** Compartments the Device is denied are NOT listed — not even
with `max_replication_level: none` — because the summary itself replicates to (or lives
on) the Device it describes, and naming a denied Compartment by its real `compartment_id`
would hand that Device the identity and existence of a Compartment it is not authorized
to know. Denial of any unlisted Compartment is implicit under default-deny. This is a
direct consequence of the redaction-identity invariant (§10) and security invariant #13
(§24): no real Compartment id or label may reach a Device that the Compartment denies,
and a Device's own registry record is not exempt.

Required `trust_state` values: `unregistered`, `trusted`, `limited`, `stale`, `revoked`,
`lost`, `retired`.

Required `sync_state` values: `active`, `offline`, `pending_sync`, `syncing`,
`sync_failed`, `stale`, `revoked`.
