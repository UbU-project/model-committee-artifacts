## UBU-Q0076: Planning horizon, early-preparation bias, and short-horizon time discounting

Status: Open Priority: Research Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Process Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016, UBU-Q0051 Blocks: detailed planning horizon policy, premium planning horizon design Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-10-14 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How far beyond the visible Calendar window should UbU look, when should prerequisite work be front-loaded, and when does time discounting become relevant to detailed planning?

### Subquestions

1. What is the default internal look-ahead for a one-day visible Calendar?
2. When should a dependency chain be scheduled early rather than just in time?
3. What makes a prerequisite chain fragile enough to justify early preparation?
4. Should one week be the default upper bound for detailed local planning?
5. Which longer-horizon plans belong to premium cloud, user-owned worker, or research modes?
6. When should explicit temporal-discounting Preferences override the short-horizon zero-discount assumption?

### Current direction

The internal planning horizon may exceed the visible Calendar window. Fragile prerequisites should be completed as early as reasonably viable within short detailed horizons to avoid forced stressful choices later. For operational windows of one day to roughly one week, time discounting may usually be treated as negligible unless user Preferences say otherwise.

### Resolution

Open.

## Patch baseline

The patch must apply to the **current working-tree files** in the repository above.
The selected question and context excerpts come from that working tree, which may
include uncommitted ranking and metadata updates.

- Set the JSON `base_commit` field to `afb7d1a9290fbf8ec346e04b59331226d139d2fa` for provenance. It does not
  define the patch's file contents: do not use `git show HEAD:<path>` or the Git index
  as the original version when it differs from the working tree.
- Use exact working-tree lines for all removed and unchanged lines. Preserve existing
  metadata updates and exclude unrelated edits from the proposal.
- To generate the diff, compare unmodified working-tree copies with the proposed
  contents. Validate against the working tree with `git apply --check`; a successful
  `git apply --check --cached` checks the index and is insufficient.

## Canonical design context

The excerpts below are **not** the whole canonical files. They are the subset selected by
following references from the selected question: its dependencies, the decisions those
questions cite, and the sections those cite in turn.

Read them under these rules:

- **Absence is not non-existence.** Ids and sections you cannot see here still exist.
  Never conclude that a question is unasked, a decision unmade, or a section absent
  because it is not shown.
- **Do not renumber or reuse ids.** Allocate new entries from the next free ids below.
- **Patch context must match the real file.** Hunks are applied against the full files,
  not against these excerpts, and `git apply` locates them by surrounding context. Quote
  surrounding lines exactly as they appear here.
- **Scope your edits to what you can see.** Do not delete or rewrite text on the
  assumption that it duplicates something outside these excerpts.

Next free ids — use these for anything you add:

- next question id: `UBU-Q0191`
- next decision id: `UBU-D0349`

`DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` is read-only context and is not in the patch
allowlist: do not propose changes to it.

```markdown
## UBU-D0130: UniverseState mutations use dotted targets and envelope-level provenance

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11.3

MVP UniverseState mutation items use dotted string targets. The first target segment names the UniverseState collection: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key within that collection. Examples include `facts.github.issue.14.pipeline_state`, `numeric_values.affect.energy`, `set_memberships.github.issue.14.labels`, and `event_markers.relationship.rel_123.interactions`.

A mutation item has required `operation` and `target` fields. `payload` is required for all operations except `clear_fact`. `note` is optional for human-readable context. Mutation items do not carry item-level `confidence`, `source`, or `provenance` in MVP; those belong on the containing Task effect, Snapshot, Log entry, worker mutation request, External Reference, import artifact, or projection envelope.

Payload rules are operation-specific. `set_fact` accepts any JSON-compatible value. `clear_fact` has no payload. `increment_numeric` and `decrement_numeric` require numeric delta payloads. `add_membership` and `remove_membership` require JSON scalar member payloads, usually strings. `append_event_marker` requires a JSON object payload representing the lightweight marker.

Mutation lists are unconditional once the containing Task effect succeeds. Per-item conditions are not part of the MVP mutation schema; conditional behavior belongs in Task preconditions, effect success probability, planner branching, or worker/request validation. Implementations should validate the full mutation list before application and apply valid items in list order.

Mutation targets may include affect UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, subject to Snapshot precedence and user sovereignty rules. Organization-mode and worker-mode validators must reject intrinsic-affect mutations. Mutation targets may include Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, including relationship interaction markers and maintenance facts, but they must respect Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user-acceptance requirements for private or inferred relationship claims. Task effects, workers, imports, and LLM-assisted flows must not silently overwrite user-declared private affect or Relationship truths.

#### UBU-D0131

```markdown
## UBU-D0131: Task preconditions use recursive all_of/any_of predicates

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.1

MVP Task preconditions use a recursive boolean object with `all_of` and `any_of` arrays for simple AND/OR composition. A precondition node may be a group node or a leaf predicate. A group node contains `all_of` or `any_of`, each holding one or more precondition nodes. A leaf predicate contains `target`, `predicate`, and optional `expected`.

Precondition targets use the same dotted UniverseState target convention accepted for mutations. The first segment names the UniverseState collection: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key inside that collection.

MVP predicates are `equals`, `member_of`, and `absent`. `equals` compares the target value to a JSON-compatible `expected` value. `member_of` checks whether the JSON scalar `expected` value is present in the target set membership. `absent` checks that the target is not present or has been cleared, and does not use `expected`. Numeric comparisons such as greater-than, less-than, ranges, thresholds, and arithmetic expressions are not in MVP.

Preconditions may reference `event_markers` for deterministic marker presence or equality checks. Preconditions may reference affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, subject to Snapshot precedence and user sovereignty rules; organization-mode and worker-mode validators must reject intrinsic-affect preconditions. Preconditions may reference Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, including relationship interaction markers and maintenance facts, but private or inferred relationship claims remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user acceptance where required.

A failed precondition makes the Task blocked for planning and execution. It does not make the Task invalid. `unschedulable` is a derived planner result when an otherwise valid Task cannot be placed in the current Calendar scope while satisfying preconditions and Calendar Logic. `invalid` is reserved for malformed Tasks, malformed precondition schema, forbidden targets, or canonical-state contradictions. Unknown, unavailable, or partially modeled preconditions are treated as absent in MVP unless the user or importer explicitly records a deterministic predicate.

#### DESIGN.md §2.2.1 — Preference calibration

```markdown
#### 2.2.1 Preference calibration

Phase 1 may use preference-calibration examples during onboarding, Calendar preview, and Log review. These examples describe common situations, likely emotional costs, likely emotional rewards, and plausible tradeoffs so the user can make more thoughtful Preference judgments.

Examples are not canonical Preferences. They are prompts for self-reporting. A calibration example becomes canonical only if the user accepts, edits, or answers it in a way that UbU records as a Preference, Snapshot, Log entry, Objective annotation, or review note.

Preference calibration should reduce shallow, reactive, or situationally distorted guesses without manipulating the user into a hidden value model. The user remains the final authority over Preferences.

```markdown
## 4. Release Phases

Phase labels name the phase that implements an item. The phases, their build order, and the mapping from labels used before `UBU-D0275` are recorded in §4.7.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Single-user GitHub dogfooding

A single user uses UbU to coordinate development of UbU itself.

Primary goals:

- import or observe GitHub issues, PRs, reviews, CI events, and milestones;
- represent them in UbU’s Objective/Task/Calendar model;
- generate useful Plans;
- provide a minimal bootstrap interview that creates an initial dogfooding context, current or stale affect Snapshot, and prioritized Objective/Task seed set;
- provide a next-action focus mode that shows one recommended next Task with an inspectable explanation of why it matters now;
- update GitHub as a low-dimensional projection of UbU state;
- expose limitations and open questions through dogfooding.

The frozen Phase 1 implementation set is:

- local single-user `user_mode` instance for UbU-runs-UbU;
- bootstrap interview and explicit seed model creation;
- GitHub issue, PR, review, CI, milestone, and comment import from live data or approved fixtures;
- ExternalReference-style source links sufficient to trace imported GitHub objects;
- Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, and External Reference schemas only to the depth required by the dogfooding loop;
- schedulable Static and Dynamic Tasks with Objective links, durations, dependency/precondition/effect fields, active/completed/failed/moot lifecycle handling, and moot reason codes sufficient for the demo;
- lightweight UniverseState facts, affect Snapshot handling, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation;
- append-only per-instance Logs with correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries;
- Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation;
- next-action focus mode with start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, explain-more, and feedback controls;
- derived risk and human-complete plan-quality reports covering deadline risk, dependency fragility, worker or automation bottlenecks, stale affect, affect-margin, destructive pressure, and post-plan depletion warnings;
- minimal Compartment guardrails for `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed integration/device references, low-security labeling, and logged boundary decisions;
- Automation Worker identity, scoped capability grants, explicit assignment/status display, and mutation or projection request submission without direct canonical writes;
- Delegation Substrate-compatible Task formalization fields where needed for dogfooding, worker assignment, or solo self-reminder clarity, including purpose, executor type, authority, expected output, evidence, review, privacy scope, and escalation notes;
- clearly marked GitHub projection previews or human-approved writes for UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, plus reconciliation reporting;
- manually structured Release Outreach Pipeline work items and artifact records for release notes, screenshots, scripts, and contributor calls-to-action;
- manually structured EthConf outreach notes and follow-up artifacts that dogfood Association formation and organizational introspection without requiring full multi-user Association automation.

Phase 2 explicitly defers:

- multi-device local-first sync;
- partial replication across Devices, Zones, or Compartments;
- secure cross-device Compartment propagation;
- sync conflict handling;
- cross-device worker or enclave coordination beyond the single local instance boundary.

Phase 3 is the bridge from the bootstrap MVP toward the full personal life-logistics product. It prioritizes minimal Resource/Skill-aware task readiness, private skill-tree foundations, and narrow Identity coordination that directly improves single-user life logistics. Phase 4 (§4.5) begins the full version 1.0 release track, and Phase 5+ (§4.6) continues it.

Phase 3 explicitly includes:

- minimal Resource objects and Task resource requirements sufficient to answer whether a Task is realistically ready to start or complete;
- minimal Skill objects and Task skill requirements sufficient to answer whether the user can perform a Task, needs a refresher, should learn a prerequisite, or should consider purchase/delegation;
- minimal cross-user contextual messaging between UbU instances;
- user-to-user Identity-mediated requests, status updates, questions, commitments, and blockers;
- bounded Message Context Envelopes carrying priority, interrupt recommendation, topic, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, and disclosure policy;
- legacy-message ingestion and limited upgrade paths where both parties use UbU;
- user-to-user Identity commitments, capabilities, and limited disclosure sufficient for narrow coordination;
- early Delegation Substrate use between Identities, if Phase 2/3 authority and privacy boundaries are in place.

Phase 3 still defers:

- full inventory management, full financial management, bank syncing, investment tracking, receipt OCR, tax categorization, and Quicken-like accounting workflows;
- public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and marketplace governance;
- shared global project truth between users;
- rich subjective Relationship-model exchange;
- full Association synchronization;
- multi-party governance, invitation, revocation, or trust protocols;
- broad personal-data ingestion beyond selected communication integrations.

Phase 1 keeps these abstractions documented for compatibility but does not implement them:

- Technique as a first-class planning object (minimal Technique-based Objective expansion in Phase 3, richer integration in Phase 4);
- Resource and Skill as first-class planning objects beyond lightweight compatibility placeholders (minimal readiness in Phase 3; richer integration in Phase 4);
- full Compact Calendar planner grammar and high-coverage transport format;
- complete Zone and Device system beyond the current local execution enclave;
- organization-mode and worker-mode web admin consoles;
- richer relationship-management, personal CRM, and longitudinal affect/growth models;
- full Release Outreach Pipeline video generation, rendering, and publication workflow;
- broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion outside narrow approved dogfooding fixtures;
- full realtime multimodal capture (Phase 1b MVP-release scope under `UBU-D0292`, with mandatory mode/device slices and delivery order set by `UBU-D0339` in §4.2); always-on assistant behavior remains outside this release commitment;
- public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and General Contractor subdelegation workflows;
- adaptive model-committee weighting, automatic patch application, GitHub mutation, and direct cloud-provider APIs.

Stop rule:

> A new abstraction may be added to Phase 1 only when it is required to complete the single-user GitHub dogfooding loop, enforce an accepted hard invariant, or avoid a known irreversible schema contradiction. Otherwise it must be documented as a Phase 2, Phase 3, or post-MVP concern and must not block Phase 1 implementation.

After `UBU-D0175`, new MVP blockers are allowed only when discovered during implementation of a concrete Phase 1 slice and accompanied by a blocker certificate naming the blocked object or file, failed acceptance criterion, unsafe fallback, minimum answer needed, and persistence impact. Phase 1 readiness is judged slice-by-slice rather than by global philosophical completion of the model.

### 4.1.0 Phase 1 readiness scoring

Phase 1 readiness is a derived, evidence-backed, human-reviewed signal. It reports `scope_freeze_readiness` and `mvp_readiness` from per-slice evidence, gates, and score caps rather than from raw open-question count or model confidence. Unresolved nonblocking questions do not reduce Phase 1 readiness after `UBU-D0175` unless they carry a valid blocker certificate. Model-committee may compute readiness reports and propose README readiness text, but it must not publish or update public readiness signals automatically. The accepted rubric is `UBU-D0189`.

The minimum dogfooding loop that proves UbU’s core model is:

1. bootstrap the operator, project context, available work window, constraints, and current or stale affect Snapshot;
2. import or load a curated UbU GitHub fixture with issues, PR/review/CI signals, milestone context, and source links;
3. map those inputs into Objectives, Tasks, External Events, Logs, UniverseState facts, and External References;
4. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
5. present one recommended next Task with an explanation of Objective value, dependencies, deadlines, affect constraints, worker status, and risk findings;
6. record completion, failure, snooze, rejection, decomposition, or override as Log evidence and trigger recalculation when appropriate;
7. preview or perform a human-approved UbU-managed GitHub projection update;
8. show a reconciliation or risk summary that makes the changed model inspectable.

### 4.1.1 Phase 1 public demo criteria

The Phase 1 public demo should use real UbU GitHub issues or a frozen fixture captured from real UbU GitHub data when live access is unsafe, unavailable, or non-reproducible.

The smallest persuasive demo is an end-to-end single-user dogfooding loop:

1. import a curated set of UbU issues, PR/review/CI signals, and milestone context;
2. map those inputs into Objectives, schedulable Tasks, External Events, and traceable source links;
3. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
4. show why the Plan was chosen, including dependencies and worker assignment or worker status;
5. show user-mode affect constraints by applying a current affect Snapshot or by creating an affect-collection Task when affect data is stale or missing;
6. write or preview clearly marked UbU-managed GitHub projection labels, comments, or managed blocks;
7. show a risk summary covering at least deadline risk, dependency fragility, and worker or automation bottlenecks.

The demo must not require Phase 2 sync, Phase 3 multi-user coordination, full RBAC, a complete Compact Calendar UI, or autonomous remote GitHub mutation. If live GitHub writes are unsafe for the public recording, a dry-run projection is acceptable only when it shows the exact payload that would be written after human approval.

### 4.1.2 Phase 1 user-facing loop

Phase 1 must include a minimal first-person UX loop for dogfooding. The loop is intentionally narrow: it collects explicit answers, creates explicit UbU objects, recommends one next Task, records what happened, and recalculates from Logs and current state.

1. **Bootstrap interview**
   - Ask exactly the minimum questions needed to seed the first dogfooding Plan:
     1. `What are you trying to move forward right now?`
     2. `Which project context should UbU use for this first session?`
     3. `How much usable time do you have for the next work window?`
     4. `Is there a deadline, meeting, release target, or external event that changes what matters today?`
     5. `What work should UbU consider first?`
     6. `What is already blocked, unavailable, or not worth recommending right now?`
     7. `How are your energy, stress, and mood right now?`
     8. `When choosing between useful work, what should UbU favor today?`
   - Record the project/context answer as UniverseState facts and source-linked Logs.
   - Record available time, static commitments, deadlines, and immediate constraints as UniverseState facts, Tasks, External Events, or Logs.
   - Record affect answers as a user-declared Snapshot, or create an affect-collection Task when the user skips or the data is stale.
   - Record favored tradeoffs as Preferences only when the user accepts an explicit Preference statement; otherwise retain them as Log notes or Objective annotations.
   - Seed a small Objective/Task set from user answers plus approved GitHub fixtures or configured imports.

2. **Minimum data for one recommendation**
   - A user or operator Identity.
   - At least one active Objective.
   - At least one active schedulable Task linked to that Objective with title and duration or work-window estimate.
   - A current work window or next available time.
   - Current or explicitly stale affect state.
   - Known hard blockers, deadlines, dependencies, and source references for the recommended Task when available.
   - If this minimum is missing, the next recommended Task should be a clarification, import, or affect-collection Task rather than pretending to optimize.

3. **Plan generation**
   - Generate a candidate default Plan from explicit modeled state.
   - Preserve inspectability of the full Plan.
   - Explain relevant Objective value, constraints, dependencies, deadlines, risk findings, worker status, and affect constraints.
   - Mark any fixture-backed, hardcoded, or mock recommendation path directly in the UI and run artifact.

4. **Calendar preview**
   - Treat Calendar preview as a notable recurring Task.
   - Default cadence is before the first recommended Task in a user-declared work window and after a material Calendar regeneration when UbU is about to rely on the new default Plan.
   - Let the user inspect the candidate Calendar or default Plan before relying on it.
   - Ask whether the Plan feels plausible, motivating, humane, and consistent with the user's current context.
   - Ask only lightweight model-repair questions about expected execution, perceived control, social pressure, and missing context; store raw psychological comments as review notes unless the user accepts a concrete canonical update.
   - Allow the user to correct Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, affect Snapshots, availability, or estimates before execution.
   - Let the user snooze, skip, or adjust Calendar-preview cadence through the cadence rule on its evergreen system Objective (§7.4.1).

5. **Next-action focus mode**
   - Present one recommended next Task as the default UI surface.
   - Show title, Objective link, estimated duration or work window, current status, and source/provenance label.
   - Show `why this matters now` with at least the served Objective, timing reason, main dependency or blocker status, affect/staleness status, and top risk or opportunity considered.
   - Show what UbU considered, including visible counts or links for candidate Tasks, blocked Tasks, hard constraints, affect constraints, worker/projection state, and imported or fixture sources.
   - Provide controls for start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, override, and explain more.
   - Keep full Plan inspection one action away through a Plan drawer, timeline, or inspector that shows ordered Tasks, assumptions, source links, and explanation fragments.
   - One-task focus reduces cognitive load; it must not hide the Plan, turn the recommendation into opaque automation, or imply that the user has committed to the default Plan.

6. **Feedback, Log review, and recalculation**
   - After `done`, ask whether completion matched the estimate, whether the modeled effect happened, and whether energy or stress changed enough to update the Snapshot.
   - After failure or blocked execution, ask what assumption failed: missing dependency, wrong duration, stale affect, interruption, unclear Task, changed priority, or other.
   - After snooze, ask for the next review time or condition and whether the reason is timing, affect, dependency, or user preference.
   - After rejection, ask whether the Task is wrong, not valuable now, blocked, too large, already done, duplicate, or should become moot.
   - After override, record the chosen Task or action, the reason if supplied, and whether the override should update Preferences, availability, Task estimates, Objective status, or only this Plan.
   - Treat Log review as a notable recurring Task. Default cadence is at the end of a work window or at the next startup when there are unreconciled deviations, with a weekly catch-up if routine review is skipped.
   - Store reviewed outcomes as canonical updates only when they change Logs, Snapshots, Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, or recalculation triggers; otherwise keep autonomy, competence, relatedness, attitude, subjective-norm, perceived-control, and expected-execution comments as noncanonical review notes or derived report inputs.
   - Record outcomes as Logs and trigger recalculation when the outcome changes Task status, availability, affect state, dependencies, Objective status, or user Preferences.
   - Treat failure, rejection, override, and deviation as model evidence, not user blame.

7. **Discovery mode when appropriate**
   - Allow the user to choose discovery mode at any time.
   - Show active, paused, ended, and pending-review state, enabled sources, routing or retention limits, and evidence count.
   - Provide pause, resume, exit, inspect, reject, delete, and review controls.
   - Collect only enabled Phase 1 evidence such as quick notes, user-selected current action, Calendar context, configured integration events, coarse motion or location category, focus state, and app-state category.
   - Treat inferred observations as reviewable evidence, not final truth; defer ambiguous interpretation until Log review or user-visible reconciliation.

The Phase 1 version may be simple and fixture-backed. Fixture behavior must be labeled as fixture behavior, mock recommendations must not be described as implemented planning, and public demos should show the exact boundary between explicit UbU objects, approved fixtures, and implemented planner behavior. The public demonstration pattern is bootstrap, one recommended next Task, explanation, user feedback, recalculation, and full-Plan inspection. It does not require broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion. It must not claim complete life-modeling, therapeutic authority, autonomous life coaching, complete planning automation, full privacy isolation, Phase 2 sync, or Phase 3 multi-user coordination. The purpose is to demonstrate the core UbU experience: one meaningful next action, with an explanation, grounded in explicit state.

### 4.1.3 Release Outreach Pipeline dogfooding

The Release Outreach Pipeline should become part of ordinary UbU-runs-UbU release management. A minor release should produce a release outreach package when the current project state contains enough user-visible, developer-visible, or contributor-visible change to justify public explanation.

The Phase 1 package is manual but structured. Minimum package artifacts are:

- `manifest.json` with release, source, Identity, Compartment, status, and hash metadata;
- `claim_register.json` with audience, support status, evidence refs, and review state for each public claim;
- `evidence_index.json` for source artifacts, hashes, selectors, and provenance;
- release-note, script, narration/caption, announcement, and publication-metadata drafts when relevant;
- `media_refs.json` for approved screenshots, UI-test exports, fixture captures, or recordings;
- `export_review.json`, `approvals.json`, and `publication_plan.json`;
- known-limitations, future-work, and contributor call-to-action notes tied to real artifacts.

Media provenance records must distinguish approved live captures, approved fixture/synthetic captures, UI-test exports, and mock/demo-only captures. Every claim in scripts, release notes, and public posts links to claim-register evidence and uses the support labels accepted in `UBU-D0180`.

Phase 1 dogfooding may generate text drafts, collect approved screenshots or recordings, assemble a publication plan, and record human approvals. It may use local renderers or LLM/script workers only as Automation Workers that produce candidate artifacts under capability grants.

Post-MVP work includes automatic UI capture generation, demo-flow export, script drafting from repository state, narration and caption generation, thumbnail generation, video rendering automation, platform upload, social posting, mailing-list publication, analytics feedback, and trusted auto-publication policies.

The full video-generation and publication pipeline remains future work. Phase 1 should generate reviewable communication artifacts before trying to automate external publication.

### 4.1.4 EthConf outreach as Association-introspection dogfooding

EthConf outreach is a Phase 1 dogfooding workflow for Association formation and organizational introspection.

Phase 1 represents the workflow with ordinary Objectives, Tasks, Logs, External Events, External References, Release Outreach package artifacts, public dogfooding review packages, and manually reviewed candidate AssociationAttestations. It does not require full Association automation, multi-user Association sync, automatic contact analysis, or broad message/archive ingestion.

Minimum evidence set:

- canonical design files and accepted decisions;
- public dogfooding artifacts such as model-committee review packages, selected patches, issue fixtures, release outreach packages, and public retrospectives;
- structured EthConf outreach notes with private details separated from redacted public summaries;
- follow-up Tasks, missed follow-ups, public replies, contributor/funder/design-partner next actions, and outcome Logs.

Minimum outputs:

- candidate AssociationAttestations about declared project mission, outreach commitments, observed follow-through, and evidence gaps;
- mission-alignment questions, especially whether outreach behavior supports the privacy-first self-governance, contributor-recruitment, workflow-discovery, and compatible-funding goals;
- priority-drift observations and commitment-mismatch notes;
- follow-up Tasks with owners, review dates, evidence refs, and public/private disclosure labels;
- redacted retrospective notes suitable for public dogfooding artifacts.

The core review prompt is: `Does UbU's actual outreach behavior prove, from reviewable evidence, that the project pursued its stated goals?` The answer may be yes, no, mixed, or insufficient evidence, and must cite evidence or gaps rather than model confidence alone.

Public artifacts expose only redacted summaries, evidence selectors, hashes, public links, reviewed claims, and approved follow-up Tasks. They must not expose private notes, raw contact details, unapproved conversation content, private funding terms, private relationship hypotheses, or Compartment-protected payloads.

Acceptance criteria: the workflow produces one evidence-backed retrospective, at least one candidate AssociationAttestation or explicit no-evidence finding, at least one mission-alignment question, any needed follow-up Tasks, an export review, and a public-safe redacted artifact that labels fixture/manual/LLM-assisted content. A human reviewer must be able to trace each public claim to evidence or to a recorded evidence gap.

### 4.1.5 Optional VoxPopuli EthConf demo

UbU may optionally demonstrate a **VoxPopuli** flow at EthConf if it does not displace higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, or funder deliverables. In this flow, a user speaks freely about what they wish would happen or what feels disorganized. An LLM-assisted extractor converts that natural-language input into candidate Objectives, Tasks, constraints, preferences, and planning assumptions for the user to inspect, correct, accept, or reject.

VoxPopuli is a trust-building outreach hook, not a replacement for the narrow Phase 1 bootstrap interview. It should demonstrate how LLMs can help structure abstract human concerns while UbU remains the explicit, inspectable planning system.

### 4.1.6 Phase 1 implementation priority order

Phase 1 implementation proceeds in this priority order:

1. Remove all in-memory orchestrator state (`MemoryState`) and fully implement `ubu_store` as the canonical local admission and persistence path for the running loop.
2. Log event vocabulary: correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries.
3. UniverseState facts.
4. Affect Snapshot content, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation.
5. Structured bootstrap interview with seed Objective, Task, and Snapshot creation.
6. Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation.
7. Activate `ubu_github_adapter` as a functioning orchestrator dependency for import, projection preview, approved writes, and reconciliation.

The remaining §4.1 frozen-set items follow in bootstrap-dependency-driven ordering: persistence and vocabulary precede the features that must reference them.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0241`).** Step 3 (UniverseState facts) is foundationally realized, together with the accepted mutation vocabulary and deterministic precondition evaluation named in step 4, implemented as the §11 container and pure `ubu-core` semantics and persisted by `ubu-store`. The precondition, effect, and bootstrap-fact wiring of these facts into the loop is realized across Wiring-A/B/C (`UBU-D0242`): preconditions gate planning, a completed Task's effects mutate the facts, and the bootstrap records the initial facts under the `UBU-D0243` namespace convention. Step 4's affect-Snapshot content is realized by the affect observation route (`UBU-D0304`); step 5's interactive bootstrap interview remains.

### 4.2 Phase 1b: Quick UbU merge through the switch

Phase 1b extends the Phase 1 system until it can replace Quick UbU, the separately developed personal planner that serves as the dogfooding user's working daily tool, so that Quick UbU becomes legacy software (`UBU-D0275`).

Exit criterion:

> The switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU.

Phase 1b closed by decision on 2026-10-10 (`UBU-D0305`), with its planner condition discharged by the greedy Stage 1 certification under the CPU tensor-worker profile (`UBU-D0303`). The ratification gate of `UBU-D0291` was met with no provisional subject root; its registry remains the standing agenda, evaluated at the deferred switch. The switch is not in force and follows the completion of Phase 2.

Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data. (The switch is deferred until Phase 2 is complete (`UBU-D0305`).)

**The Phase 1b rule.** Every Quick UbU feature merged into mainline adopts the restrictions, forms, and functional boundaries of the MVP design it corresponds to, even when that design's implementation phase is later. Open questions that block Phase 1b are answered during Phase 1b whatever phase they were previously tagged, and the items they pull forward are re-tagged Phase 1b.

Phase 1b includes:

- the Phase 1b foundations already decided, including sync-ready mutation envelopes, the Device registry, tombstones, redacted Handles, projection-conflict repair, Device-local credentials, the local advisory worker, advisory batches, and first-class advisory candidate review;
- the Quick UbU practical features, ported under the Phase 1b rule;
- the planner the switch requires: decomposition into Containers whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together (§9.4); an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks (§7.4.1); partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend with its CPU reference path (§16.10).

**MVP-release scope amendment (`UBU-D0292`, sequenced by `UBU-D0339`).** Local camera-and-voice interaction, including explicitly enabled realtime capture, remains in the Phase 1b MVP-release backlog. Phase 1b's closure does not establish release completion or implemented capture. `UBU-D0339` resolves `UBU-Q0183`'s scope allocation below; implementation proceeds alongside Phase 2 without reopening Phase 1b or changing `UBU-D0305`'s switch criteria. `UBU-Q0128` remains Phase 1b-origin work now tracked in Phase 2; Phase 3 does not gate this interaction surface. Mobile planning retains `UBU-D0290`'s stewardship workload and parity rules; any workload/API or stewardship amendment still requires `UBU-Q0160`.

**Capture delivery order (`UBU-D0339`).** Deliver the following slices in order. Rows 1–3 are mandatory before MVP release; exact hardware/software configurations require evidence-backed selection under `UBU-Q0177`. A Device is an execution enclave: qualify each capture, review and inference endpoint and any inter-Device route, even on shared physical hardware.

| Order | Required mode/device slice | Delivery boundary |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Operator-owned laptop/desktop: `off`/`text_only`, bounded still-image capture and push-to-talk voice, with independently selectable speech output; `snapshot_capture` and `conversational` classes. | Establish §21.1.3's common concern-to-candidate, exact correction, review/admission and next-action loop, plus every ordinary voice and text/form workflow. Camera preview or transcription alone cannot pass. Keep the complete manual loop usable with capture and models disabled. |
| 2 | At least one qualified phone capture/review profile: bounded still images and push-to-talk voice through the same loop. | Inference may run on that phone or a separately qualified operator-owned laptop/desktop worker through an authenticated encrypted, policy-authorized route. Show the chosen route before acquisition/dispatch; worker loss preserves permitted drafts and useful text/forms. This allocates interaction, without selecting a mobile planner or compute API. |
| 3 | At least one qualified laptop/desktop profile: explicitly started, finite local realtime sessions in ordinary-attention `voice_session` and Task-scoped `discovery_mode`, using the `local_only_realtime` route. | Support microphone-only, camera-only and simultaneous ongoing audio/live-camera input; repeated one-shot captures alone cannot satisfy this slice. Demonstrate `conversational` and `streamed_supervision` classes, visible source state and gaps, pause/resume/stop, interruption and reviewable updates. Models propose evidence/candidates; only ordinary review/admission changes state. |

**Evidence and retention precede enablement.** Each slice needs revision-pinned passing §21.1.1 host-mapping, qualifier, corroboration and admission evidence for its enabled adapters (`UBU-Q0166`), §21.1.3 usefulness/access evidence including `UBU-D0338`'s affected user-tested workflows, §21.1.4 numerical and deadline-boundary results (`UBU-Q0168`), and §1's endpoint/runtime qualification (`UBU-Q0177`, `UBU-D0331`, `UBU-D0336`). Unsupported mappings remain unresolved; failed mandatory gates withhold the affected slice. Select at least one bounded camera-and-voice path from rows 1–2 under `UBU-Q0178`'s reviewed ownership/budget comparison (`UBU-D0332`, `UBU-D0337`), including CPU-only and existing-worker candidates and explicit no-worker gaps; manual fallback does not establish multimodal reach.

Before row 3 is exposed, demonstrate §21.1.5's broker isolation, finite aggregate limits, original-time/coverage bindings and bounded cancellation (`UBU-D0326`), plus §12.2's enforced memory-only raw buffer ceiling of 60 seconds, copy/cache/swap controls, expiry/restart cleanup and policy-filtered inspection/discard controls (`UBU-D0327`–`UBU-D0328`). No automatic derivative archive replaces discarded media. Retained minimized evidence/candidates need their own permitted purpose and retention authority. Optional summary/hash/clip/export controls stay unavailable until their separate retention, review and routing gates pass; capture consent never authorizes saving or exporting.

**Coordination with the switch and device wave.** Build and qualify these slices against non-primary test data while Phase 2 develops Device trust, Compartment policy, sync and personal-worker routes. Cross-Device inference waits for its endpoint/route gates; permitted candidate exchange uses the existing Phase 2 contract and carries no live source consent or approval. Exercise phone/desktop switching, corrections, partial replicas, stale policy, revocation and restart without stale admission, duplicate effects or implicit capture resumption. Phase 2's existing three-Device sync freeze evidence remains required independently; its third Device need not implement AV. Release integration and operator-reviewed acceptance follow Phase 2 completion and the deferred switch under `UBU-D0305`/`UBU-D0291`. A capture shortfall blocks MVP-release completion, without adding a switch criterion or reversing Phase 1b closure.

Publish the release support matrix by Device/backend/mode with enabled sources/classes, finite session/resource limits, measured results, user-tested access combinations, retention/security outcomes, approved cost scenarios and useful fallbacks. Phone streaming, meeting/multi-party logging, retrospective analysis, cloud-assisted interaction, other sensitive sources and restricted-attention interaction beyond immediate local controls are subsequent separately qualified slices, not prerequisites for this release minimum. Withhold unavailable processing/review under §21.1.2 while keeping immediate local pause/stop/silence available; always-on capture is outside the commitment. Resource/Skill/Technique-dependent scenarios retain their later phases.

The richer household apprentice, maintenance triage, purchasing defense, Skill evidence and tacit-expertise examples depend on first-class Technique, Resource and Skill implementations. They are phased but unimplemented dependencies: Phase 3 supplies minimal readiness and Technique-based Objective expansion, and Phase 4 supplies richer integration. Evidence semantics, hardware suitability and scenario-specific scope remain unresolved. Camera-first MVP scope does not promise that those later planning objects or scenarios are MVP-ready.

Phase 1b defers multi-device sync and everything else assigned to Phase 2 and later.

### 4.3 Phase 2: Single-user multi-device synchronization

A single user runs UbU across multiple Devices / execution enclaves.

Phase 2 is in development from 2026-10-10 (`UBU-D0305`), and the switch of `UBU-D0275` follows its completion.

Phase 2 validates:

- local-first sync;
- partial replication;
- Zone and Compartment boundaries;
- device roles;
- conflict handling;
- user-owned worker execution on the user's laptop, desktop, or other trusted personal compute device.

Design rubric:

> Phase 2 should feel like multi-agent coordination, but all agents happen to agree.

A Phase 2 personal worker is not a mandatory cloud dependency. It is an optional execution backend for a user's own UbU instance. It may provide more CPU, GPU, memory, storage, network availability, or battery-independent runtime than the mobile device while preserving the user's practical control over the compute environment.

### 4.4 Phase 3: Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination

Multiple humans coordinate through explicit Identities, capabilities, limited disclosure, and commitments.

Phase 3 should enable coordination without surveillance or shared global truth.

### 4.5 Phase 4: Version 1.0 release track

Phase 4 begins the full version 1.0 release track. It expands Resource and Skill usability, Technique-database integration, DIY-versus-purchase/hire planning, and the user-facing capability graph without requiring the public Skill Barter marketplace.

### 4.6 Phase 5+: Version 1.0+ release track

Phase 5+ continues the full version 1.0+ track with mature inventory, financial-management extensions, public or federated Skill Barter, reputation/evidence, dispute workflows, and other multi-party marketplace features.

### 4.7 Phase map and build order

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | ETHConf NYC demo | Complete |
| Phase 1 | Single-user GitHub dogfooding (§4.1) | Feature-complete |
| Phase 1b | Quick UbU merge through the switch, including the planner (§4.2) | Complete (closed by decision 2026-10-10, UBU-D0305; switch deferred until Phase 2 is complete) |
| Phase 2 | Single-user multi-device synchronization (§4.3) | In development (from 2026-10-10, UBU-D0305) |
| Phase 3 | Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination and Resource/Skill task readiness (§4.4) | Planned |
| Phase 4 | Version 1.0 release track (§4.5) | Planned |
| Phase 5+ | Version 1.0+ release track (§4.6) | Planned |

Phases are built in table order. A phase label names the phase that implements an item; pulling an item forward re-tags that item and never renumbers phases (`UBU-D0275`). Labels used before `UBU-D0275` map as follows: Phase 3A becomes Phase 3, Phase 3B becomes Phase 4, and Phase 4+ becomes Phase 5+.

#### DESIGN.md §8.6 — Preference calibration examples

```markdown
### 8.6 Preference calibration examples

A **PreferenceCalibrationExample** is a user-facing prompt or scenario used to help the user make better Preference judgments. It may describe a common emotional cost, common emotional reward, motivation ambiguity, social-pressure pattern, or tradeoff.

Preference calibration examples are MVP-important onboarding and review aids. They are not canonical value objects unless the user accepts or edits the resulting judgment into a Preference or other canonical entry.

The minimum Phase 1 calibration library has six example frames:

- `urgent_vs_important`: urgent external commitment versus important but nonurgent Objective;
- `emotional_cost_vs_visible_progress`: emotionally costly repair, clarification, or maintenance work versus easier visible progress;
- `social_pressure_vs_planned_objective`: socially pressured request versus planned user-chosen Objective;
- `recovery_vs_more_work`: recovery or rest versus another useful Task;
- `short_term_relief_vs_long_term_importance`: short-term relief or cleanup versus long-term capability, relationship, or project importance;
- `ambiguity_vs_decomposition`: decomposition of ambiguous work versus starting a larger unclear Task.

Each example identifies one or more calibration dimensions: `urgent_value`, `emotional_cost`, `social_pressure`, `recovery_value`, `long_term_importance`, and `ambiguity_value`.

Default presentation budget:

- Bootstrap interview: at most two examples after the user has named real Objectives or candidate Tasks.
- Calendar preview: at most one relevant example when the default Plan appears value-misaligned, socially pressured, recovery-fragile, or unusually urgent.
- Log review: at most one relevant example for an unreconciled rejection, override, failure, or repeated deviation unless the user asks for more.

Answers become canonical only through normal admission:

- explicit accepted pairwise Objective comparisons become Preferences;
- current affect, availability, capacity, or recovery reports become Snapshots or UniverseState facts when they describe observed current state;
- preview/review answers that explain outcomes, rejections, overrides, or calibration interactions become Logs, Log annotations, or Log corrections;
- comments about Objective importance or fit that do not declare pairwise order become Objective annotations or review notes;
- raw feelings, social-pressure comments, skipped examples, and unaccepted hypotheses remain noncanonical review notes.

Calibration wording must avoid leading the user:

- use the user's actual Objectives or Tasks when possible;
- present plausible costs and rewards for both sides;
- avoid preselected answers, hidden scoring, therapy, diagnosis, moral judgment, and "should" language;
- offer `neither`, `indifferent`, `not applicable`, edit, and free-text paths;
- disclose that examples are prompts for self-reporting, not UbU's values.

Candidate fields for a calibration example include:

- `example_id`
- `version`
- `situation_summary`
- `calibration_dimensions`
- `common_emotional_costs`
- `common_emotional_rewards`
- `possible_tradeoffs`
- `calibration_question`
- `resulting_object_refs`
- `source`
- `revision_status`

Example definitions are versioned derived content. UbU may revise or retire examples when user corrections, skips, edits, repeated non-use, or review feedback show that an example is confusing or leading. Historical Logs are not rewritten.

```

#### DESIGN.md §10.1 — Preconditions

```markdown
### 10.1 Preconditions

Preconditions are deterministic constraints over UniverseState.

If preconditions are unknown or partially modeled, they are treated as absent in MVP.

MVP preconditions use a recursive object with `all_of` and `any_of` arrays for simple AND/OR composition. A leaf predicate has `target`, `predicate`, and optional `expected` fields. `target` uses the same dotted UniverseState target convention as mutations, beginning with `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`.

MVP predicates are:

- `equals`, for exact JSON-compatible equality;
- `member_of`, for checking that `expected` is present in a `set_memberships` target;
- `absent`, for checking that a target is not present or has been cleared.

Numeric comparisons are not in MVP, even for `numeric_values` targets. Numeric values may be checked only by equality or absence.

Preconditions may reference event markers, affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, and Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys when the containing Task is allowed to see those targets. Organization-mode and worker-mode validation must reject intrinsic-affect preconditions. Relationship-relevant and Compartment-protected targets remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, and user-acceptance requirements for private or inferred claims.

A failed precondition means the Task is blocked for planning and execution, not invalid. `unschedulable` is a derived planner result when no placement satisfies otherwise valid preconditions and Calendar Logic; `invalid` is reserved for malformed Tasks, malformed precondition schema, forbidden targets, or contradictions in canonical state.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0241`).** The deterministic evaluator — recursive `all_of`/`any_of`, leaf predicates `equals`/`member_of`/`absent`, unknown or partially modeled targets treated as absent, malformed preconditions surfaced as evaluation errors — is implemented as a pure `ubu-core` function over a UniverseState. Attaching `preconditions` to the Task schema and consuming the evaluator are realized in Wiring-A (`UBU-D0242`); effect application and bootstrap fact-recording remain.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0242`, Wiring-A).** A Task carries optional `preconditions`, and the orchestrator evaluates them against the current UniverseState via the pure `ubu-core` evaluator during request building, partitioning Tasks: satisfied or absent → eligible, a failed precondition → **blocked** (excluded from planning and surfaced), a malformed precondition → **invalid** (surfaced distinctly). Only eligible Tasks reach the kernel, which is unchanged. This realizes the §10.1 blocked result in the orchestrator; the planner's placement-based `unschedulable` is a separate concern, untouched.
```

#### DESIGN.md §11.3 — Mutation vocabulary

```markdown
### 11.3 Mutation vocabulary

MVP mutations support:

- `set_fact`
- `clear_fact`
- `increment_numeric`
- `decrement_numeric`
- `add_membership`
- `remove_membership`
- `append_event_marker`

MVP mutation items use a small deterministic schema. Required fields are `operation` and `target`; `payload` is required except for `clear_fact`; `note` is optional. Mutation items do not carry item-level confidence, source, or provenance in MVP. Those belong on the containing Task effect, Snapshot, Log entry, worker mutation request, External Reference, or other envelope.

Targets are dotted strings. The first segment names the UniverseState collection being changed: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key inside that collection. Example targets include `facts.github.issue.14.pipeline_state`, `numeric_values.affect.energy`, `set_memberships.github.issue.14.labels`, and `event_markers.relationship.rel_123.interactions`. The first post-collection segment is a controlled-vocabulary `<subject>` governed by `UBU-D0243`, the final segment is a snake_case `<predicate>`, and any segments between form an entity/instance path.

Payload rules by operation:

- `set_fact`: any JSON-compatible value;
- `clear_fact`: no payload;
- `increment_numeric` / `decrement_numeric`: numeric delta payload;
- `add_membership` / `remove_membership`: JSON scalar member payload, usually a string;
- `append_event_marker`: JSON object payload describing the lightweight marker.

A Task effect's mutation list is unconditional once that effect succeeds. Conditional behavior belongs in Task preconditions, effect success probability, or planner branching, not in individual mutation items. Implementations should validate the full mutation list before applying it and apply valid items in list order.

Mutation targets may include affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`; organization and worker modes must reject intrinsic-affect mutations. Mutation targets may include Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, but inferred or worker-generated relationship facts remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user acceptance where required. Task effects should not silently overwrite user-declared private affect or Relationship truths.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0242`, Wiring-B).** A minimal `InstanceMode` (the §5 modes) and a pure `ubu-core` validation enforce the organization/worker-mode rejection of intrinsic-affect targets for **both** preconditions (§1585) and mutations (this section). A target is intrinsic-affect by namespace — the segment after its collection is `affect` (e.g. `numeric_values.affect.energy`). In `user_mode` such targets are permitted; in organization or worker mode they make the Task `invalid`. The orchestrator passes the instance mode (`user_mode` for the MVP single-user instance), so the rejection is dormant but encoded and tested. The user-declared-private-truths guard above remains deferred (it needs a provenance/acceptance model).

```

#### DESIGN.md §15.2.2 — Skeleton Plans and legitimization

```markdown
### 15.2.2 Skeleton Plans and legitimization

The planning pipeline begins with a **skeleton Plan**. A skeleton Plan affixes all Static Tasks and recursively walks backward through dependency DAGs from terminal Static Tasks to dependency roots, then schedules root prerequisites before their dependents. The skeleton Plan is a causal/dependency foundation, not a complete optimized user Plan.

A dependency is a requirement that some state be true before a dependent Task begins. During skeletonization, UbU must check whether that state is already satisfied by the initial UniverseState before inserting prerequisite Tasks. If a viable skeleton Plan cannot be created, the planning model is blocked, contradictory, incomplete, or impossible enough that UbU should stop ordinary planning and ask the user for clarification with a concrete diagnostic explanation.

After skeletonization, UbU performs **legitimization**. Legitimization adds the minimum human-viability constraints and support Tasks needed to make the skeleton Plan plausibly executable by the user. Examples include affect constraints, breaks, recovery Tasks, meals, sleep, transition buffers, setup/teardown time, context-switch limits, and basic sustainability requirements.

The legitimized skeleton Plan is the baseline feasible Plan. Phase 1 treats full legitimization as a finalist oracle: it runs for the baseline and for the small finalist set selected after cheap pruning, not inside every high-fan-out candidate-construction step unless measurements show it is cheap enough. Semi-legitimization is a conservative cheap filter and ranking signal. It may reject obvious legitimacy failures, but uncertain candidates must reach full legitimization before becoming the default Plan.

Minimum skeleton Plan representation records:

- Static Task placements with fixed start and end times;
- the dependency DAG frontier used for the current planning scope;
- prerequisite roots whose required state is not already true in the initial UniverseState;
- ordered prerequisite chains and the dependency or precondition refs that justify them;
- initial UniverseState assumptions, including known true, known false, assumed, and unresolved planner-relevant facts;
- unsatisfied dependency diagnostics with the failing Task, missing state, causal chain, and clarification alternatives when available.

Skeleton failure diagnostics are blocking when no valid skeleton baseline can be produced for the current Calendar scope. A diagnostic records:

- `failure_class`: one of `missing_starting_state`, `impossible_dependency`, `cyclic_dependency`, `static_task_collision`, `insufficient_calendar_window`, `unavailable_resource`, `blocked_external_event`, or `unknown_precondition`;
- severity, affected Task refs, missing or conflicting state, relevant Static Task or time-window refs, initial UniverseState assumption refs, source or External Event refs, and the shortest causal chain needed to explain the failure;
- safe clarification alternatives, each with an action enum, required user input, and the state mutation or Plan repair it would permit.

The user-facing explanation shows the failed Task or state, the immediate cause, and at most three causal-chain steps by default, with full inspector detail available. Wording frames the problem as an incomplete or contradictory model, not user failure.

Safe alternatives are limited to: provide or correct starting state, mark the required state already satisfied, add a prerequisite Task, relax a deadline or Static Task constraint, extend the planning horizon, remove or moot the blocked Task, choose an already-modeled alternate Technique or Task path, wait for or record an External Event, or ask for manual decision. UbU must not invent a new canonical Resource, Skill, Technique, Preference, or external fact merely to repair skeletonization.

A skeleton failure becomes an immediate blocking prompt when it prevents any valid baseline for the current Calendar, current or next recommended Task, a Static Task placement, a hard dependency or precondition, deadline feasibility, or a required Resource or External Event. It may remain a normal planning warning only when a valid skeleton exists and the failed chain is outside the current recommendation path or future horizon, in which case UbU records the diagnostic and marks the relevant Calendar, explanation, or risk report stale.

Partial placement (`UBU-D0289`) refines the insufficient-window case for optional Dynamic Tasks. Once a valid baseline exists, failure to fit an optional Dynamic Task in the current horizon is a local unplaced diagnostic rather than a whole-Plan rejection. Structural failures, Static collisions, hard dependency or precondition contradictions, missing required state or resources, and any inability to place mandatory routine occurrences or required support Tasks remain blocking because they prevent a legitimate baseline or required path.

Full legitimization records the constraints it enforced and any support Tasks or buffers it inserted. Its hard result is `passed`, `failed`, or `needs_clarification`. Graded fields such as `legitimacy_score`, `legitimacy_margin`, and `legitimacy_delta_from_baseline` are advisory comparison signals, not permission to violate hard legitimacy.

In Phase 1, `full_legitimize` implements the **affect-feasibility filter** (`UBU-D0236`). It computes each active dimension's sigmoid satisfaction from the AffectProfile and the affect observation, marks the candidate affect-feasible only when every dimension meets its threshold, and records per-dimension satisfaction, the `violated_dimensions`, and an `affect_margin` that is the legitimacy margin while affect is the only enforced constraint. Store-built planning runs in `warn_only` while none of the calibration Settings checked by `build_affect_profile` is present, whether the observation is live or a stand-in (`UBU-D0304`); uncalibrated priors do not block an otherwise feasible Plan. Presence of any such floor or ceiling Setting makes the profile calibrated and keeps `enforce`, including an explicit value equal to a default. Missing or stale affect still falls back in `warn_only`. A supplied full request retains its own mode and freshness limits. Support-task insertion — breaks, recovery, meals, sleep, and transition buffers — and `semi_legitimize` are deferred follow-ons within full legitimization; Phase 1 legitimization is the affect filter only.

The Phase 1 semi-legitimization heuristic set is affect budget, slack preservation, dependency fragility, user-mode compatibility, local repair viability, and legitimacy-delta estimate. Semi-legitimization returns `passes_cheap_checks`, `reject_obvious`, or `needs_full_legitimization`; it is not sufficient to certify a default Plan.

A higher-value brittle Plan may beat a lower-value humane Plan only when it passes full legitimization, preserves minimum slack and repair envelopes, avoids destructive pressure, and does not leave the user in a worse post-plan state. Otherwise the lower-value humane Plan, or the legitimized skeleton baseline, remains the default.

Recuperative support required for legitimacy is not gap-filling. Meals, sleep, rest, breaks, recovery, setup/teardown, transition buffers, affect collection, and checkpoint work inserted or protected by legitimization are ordinary Tasks or buffers with explanation lineage and protected criticality. They are placed before optional Dynamic Tasks and before `gap_fill_policy` suggestions; crowding them out invalidates or degrades the candidate.

After legitimization, the minimum candidate Plan representation includes materialized Task placements, decision envelopes for movable Tasks, Plan probability metadata, value score, semi-legitimization summary when used, full legitimacy result or score, hard-validation status, protected support refs, and explanation lineage back to Objectives, dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, worker status, risk findings, and probability inputs.
```

#### DESIGN.md §16 — Compact Calendar

```markdown
## 16. Compact Calendar

A compact Calendar is a transport/storage representation of a Calendar.

It is intended to efficiently represent a large set of possible Plans.

Compact Calendar support is considered important for MVP because it enables recursive self-analysis and transport between devices/workers.

### 16.1 Compact Calendar concept

A compact Calendar may include:

- Task set;
- Static Tasks;
- Dynamic Tasks;
- skeleton Plan metadata;
- legitimized skeleton baseline;
- ordering constraints;
- duration distributions;
- Task success probabilities;
- external-event trigger distributions;
- modeled interruption distributions;
- affect-state uncertainty and constraints;
- deterministic expansion grammar;
- probability provenance expressions and correlation-group references;
- expansion threshold(s);
- coverage value;
- default Plan reference or materialized default Plan;
- stored user-previewed, risk-report, or debug Plans when policy requires them;
- short-horizon branch cache;
- decision envelopes;
- protected, flexible, and disposable Task metadata;
- cached explanations and repair recipes;
- execution-mode metadata such as time delta, branch horizon, CPU/GPU resource limits, and privacy-routing limits.

**Phase 1 surfacing (`UBU-D0238`).** The Compact Calendar surfaces the selected finalist's `display_probability` with its Wilson interval, the p10 rollout robustness, and the `probability_quality` (`full`/`degraded_numeric_jitter`/`degraded_independence`/`not_estimated`); non-finalist alternatives are surfaced with `not_estimated`.

**Phase 1 surfacing (`UBU-D0240`).** The Compact Calendar and next-action also surface the risk report — the aggregated `level` and the categorized findings, with blocking findings prominent — and the six `human_complete_plan_quality` signals with their non-blaming `revision_suggestions`.

### 16.2 Coverage

Coverage belongs to the compact serialization, not the abstract Calendar. It is an estimated regeneration metric in Phase 1, not an exact proof.

Coverage represents the modeled probability mass of possible futures covered by the compact representation within the recorded coverage scope, usually the reactive horizon. MVP coverage includes modeled duration uncertainty, Task success/failure uncertainty when success probabilities affect branch reconstruction, and modeled external-event or interruption assumptions. Objective recurrence uncertainty is not included in MVP coverage; evergreen recurrence is evaluated deterministically before Calendar generation or repair unless a later schema adds stochastic recurrence inputs.

A compact Calendar stores `coverage_estimate`, `uncovered_mass_estimate`, `coverage_scope`, `coverage_threshold_used`, `coverage_inputs_summary`, `probability_quality`, and warning or diagnostic refs when inputs are unmodeled, stale, or degraded.

For chunked search, covered futures are the chunk-boundary outcome states that have certified precomputed continuations. The estimate sums the modeled probability mass of those outcome states within `coverage_scope`; it does not count K decision alternatives as coverage unless they are attached to a modeled outcome state.

The default Phase 1 regeneration threshold is `0.99` short-horizon branch coverage. The effective policy resolves Calendar-specific override first, then execution-profile or Device policy, then the global default. The effective threshold is stored with the compact Calendar for replayable regeneration decisions.

After time advances, coverage is recalculated by conditioning the compact Calendar on elapsed time and accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, and user actions, then discarding expired branch mass and re-estimating the remaining covered mass.

If recalculated coverage falls below the effective threshold, UbU records or batches a `low_compact_calendar_coverage` recalculation trigger and includes the finding in risk reporting. Immediate recalculation is required only when low coverage can affect the current or next recommended Task, hard feasibility, affect legitimacy, or the default Plan; otherwise marking the Calendar stale is sufficient. Low coverage does not directly create a canonical Task or worker assignment.

### 16.3 Planner grammar direction

Compact Calendar planning is no longer framed as a bare DFS process that directly produces the default Plan. The current architecture is:

1. Build the skeleton Plan from Static Tasks and dependency DAGs.
2. Legitimize the skeleton Plan into a minimally human-viable baseline.
3. Generate richer candidate Plans by adding optional Dynamic Tasks, alternative placements, and alternative Techniques for the same Objectives (§16.3.1).
4. Use semi-legitimization or full legitimization to reject unrealistic candidates.
5. Validate finalists against hard constraints.
6. Select the user-facing default Plan by Plan probability among deterministic candidate Plans.
7. Package compact repair metadata for runtime use.

DFS-like search may still be useful for candidate construction. BFS-like search may still be useful for near-term divergence. Greedy selection may still be useful as a deliberately unintelligent baseline. None of those algorithms is the complete planning architecture by itself.

Execution profiles are additive rather than mutually exclusive. The greedy mean-duration planner is the required MVP benchmark. Local and mobile profiles must support deterministic skeletonization, conservative legitimization, exact hard-constraint checks, local repair recipes, and a short-horizon branch cache. Desktop, worker, and hosted profiles may add DFS-like candidate construction, local search, solver-backed finalist validation, and GPU-friendly scoring or simulation. GPU or learned search may propose and score candidates, but exact or conservative validation certifies the selected Plan.

**Chunked search (`UBU-D0279`).** Phase 1b candidate construction partitions the horizon into chunks at capacity-occupying Static Tasks and other fixed placements. The search first assigns placement units to chunks. That is the coupled step, constrained by allowed ranges, dependencies, and state carried between chunks. It then orders each chunk's units independently and in parallel, sweeping chunks in time order and pruning at chunk boundaries. Rollouts evaluate chunks separately, sharing latent draws across chunks. The CPU reference path and the GPU engine share these semantics, and the current chunk is the unit of local repair.

**Splittable Tasks (`UBU-D0284`).** Atomic Tasks and compiled decomposition segments occupy one chunk. A splittable Task may assign at most one piece to each eligible chunk, and every piece must remain inside the Task's allowed range. The chunk-assignment level chooses how much work from the Task enters each chunk; ordinary within-chunk ordering then places that piece. The first piece has no resume overhead, while each later piece reserves the Task's constant `resume_overhead_seconds` before doing more work. Rollouts draw one total work duration for the Task, spend it across pieces, and count a continuation into a later eligible chunk as feasible only when `max_pieces`, window, dependencies, and carried state still permit it. Splittable work earns proportional scheduled-work value for completed sampled work inside the horizon, but completion, effects, and outgoing dependencies still wait for the last piece. Phase 1b needs no additional interruption input beyond the split policy; later stochastic interruption modeling can use the same policy to distinguish continuation from restart.

**Partial placement (`UBU-D0289`).** Candidate construction is best-effort for optional Dynamic work after Static placements, mandatory routine occurrences, baseline/support work, and prerequisites of placed work are protected. If capacity is short, optional units are omitted deterministically by lowest value, then latest deadline or `latest_finish`, then Task id. The response stays usable when at least one certifiable candidate remains, with omitted units reported as unplaced diagnostics; their dependents are deferred rather than independently scheduled. The CPU may make one policy-bounded horizon-extension attempt before deferral when extension is an allowed safe alternative, but it records whether extension was skipped, attempted, or exhausted. Under chunked search, unplaced reasons distinguish not enough total free capacity from no eligible chunk large enough for an atomic unit. Splittable Tasks may be partially placed across eligible chunks and carry remaining work forward, but completion, effects, and outgoing dependencies wait for the final piece. Unplaced diagnostics feed Plan explanation, risk reports, and next-action context; focus mode may recommend a triage action for unplaced work, but not the unplaced work itself.

**Sweep mechanics and streaming (`UBU-D0280`, `UBU-D0281`).** The sweep expands each branch into up to K alternatives per chunk and keeps the best B partial plans after each chunk depth. It merges branches that reach the same state, and assigns the most constrained units first. Interactive requests stream certified chunk results, so the user can act on the first chunk while later chunks are still being searched; a streamed chunk stays provisional until the user starts it. Batch requests return only the final response.

**Outcome continuations (`UBU-D0285`).** At a chunk boundary, an outcome state is the equivalence class over completed units, failed or omitted units when they affect reconstruction, splittable progress and remaining work, carried UniverseState/dependency/affect state, modeled external-event or interruption assumptions, and the next chunk cursor. Rollout frequencies under shared latent draws estimate each state's probability with recorded confidence. The sweep ranks boundary outcome states by probability and precomputes CPU-certified next-chunk continuations until `branch_coverage_target` is met inside `reactive_horizon_seconds` or the compute budget is exhausted. Decision alternatives and outcome continuations share that budget: current-chunk certification and the requested K alternatives take priority, then continuation work follows descending outcome probability with recovery-critical and deadline-fragile ties first. Deviations inside a chunk use decision envelopes and repair recipes, not intra-chunk precomputed branches. Interactive streaming may expose outcome continuations incrementally after the first certified chunk, with final coverage reported in the final response.

Plan probability is represented internally as probability metadata rather than only as a display scalar. The minimum record contains a display scalar, a log probability for stable computation, an optional probability interval, provenance over the modeled probabilistic inputs, and correlation-group or scenario references when inputs are not independent. Implementations may multiply probabilities only for inputs declared independent. Correlated or unknown relationships must use joint scenarios, shared random variables, correlation groups, or conservative intervals rather than pretending independence.

### 16.3.1 Multi-Technique candidate generation and outcome comparison (Phase 3)

When an Objective can be satisfied by more than one already-modeled Technique (technicalizing, §15.2.1.1), candidate generation may produce competing candidate Plans that differ by which Technique satisfies which Objective. Comparing those candidates by their predicted real-world outcomes, and letting the user choose, is a premier Phase 3 capability and the demand-side driver for the Technique database (`UBU-Q0119`): the engine consumes Technique variety, so every additional Technique with a distinct cost/time/affect/Resource signature widens the achievable outcome frontier and improves personalization.

**Bounded search, not enumeration.** UbU must not enumerate the full cross-product of Techniques across Objectives; that is `k^N` candidates and contradicts the bounded-search commitment (§16.1, MVP planning does not require exhaustive optimal search). The required shape is **branch-and-bound with semi-legitimization as the cheap pruner**: dominated and obviously-infeasible Technique combinations are pruned during construction using `reject_obvious` / `passes_cheap_checks` (§15.2.2), and only a small Pareto-frontier finalist set reaches full legitimization and full scoring. Dominance pruning runs as a bound during search, not as a filter after enumeration.

**Dominance over the full outcome vector.** A candidate dominates another only if it is at least as good on **every** outcome axis, including robustness, affect-margin, dependency fragility, and Plan probability — not only money and time. A candidate that saves money but is more fragile or has lower completion probability is **not** dominated and must not be pruned. Pruning on a partial vector would discard exactly the robust Plans legitimization exists to protect.

**Surface outcomes, not utils.** Utils are transient internal computational artifacts, not canonical user values (§2.2, §8.5). The user-facing comparison must show concrete predicted terminal UniverseState — money expended, time spent, Resources consumed, affect cost, relaxation, and Plan probability — not a util scalar. Money is shown here as a **generic cost outcome only** (e.g. "this Technique consumes $3.95"); analysis of which account is affected, balances, or overdraft thresholds requires a financial model that UbU does not yet specify and is deferred to Phase 4/5+. UbU must not imply affordability or account impact without that model.

**User choice and revealed preference.** The user's declared or learned trade-off weights parameterize the existing `scoring_policy` weights (`utility_weight`, `robustness_weight`, `affect_margin_weight`, `schedule_diversity_weight`; `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` §2). Two modes follow: auto-select applies the weights; ask-the-user presents a small, diverse finalist set and lets the user pick. A revealed choice is a **proposal, not a fact** (`UBU-D0217`): it may propose a weight or Preference update surfaced for explicit user acceptance, and must never silently rewrite the trade-off vector. A single choice is a weak signal (one inequality in weight-space) and must be accumulated conservatively. Because trade-offs are affect- and state-conditioned, learned weights are a function of current state, not a fixed global vector.

**Confidence-gated automation.** Eventual automatic selection requires two gates in series: a confidence threshold **and** a user-granted, revocable auto-choice authority, modeled on `Auto-choice eligibility` as a governance gate separate from automation-likelihood (§3.7.1) and on the trusted-auto-publication pattern (§2.6). Confidence alone never authorizes automatic selection. Auto-selected choices remain logged, inspectable, and overridable.

**Cognitive load and cadence.** The finalist comparison uses the same UX surface and roughly the same choice counts as Calendar preview (§4.1.2): present a small curated set along the most salient trade-off axis for the current decision, elicit only when the frontier is genuinely ambiguous or the trade-off estimate is stale, and auto-select via learned/declared weights otherwise. Diverging the comparison choice count or weights from Calendar-preview defaults is a user configuration. Within-noise finalists are presented as a tie with a `sensitivity_summary`, not a manufactured ranking.

**Affect-conditioned introspection.** Repeated choices logged under a recognizable affect or time-pressure context may produce an introspection finding routed through habit-pattern reconciliation (§12.2), e.g. surfacing that the user has repeatedly chosen money over work-time when rushed before leaving, and offering to move the decision earlier (the night before, when less rushed). This finding must surface the observed **correlation** and offer a **context** remedy that changes when and how the decision is made; it must not assert a psychological mechanism, blame the user, or nudge toward the option UbU scores higher. Nudging toward a scored-better option would decide values for the user and violate `UBU-D0217`.

### 16.4 Reactive short-horizon branch layer

The default Plan is not enough for real-time use because reality can diverge from the modeled branch. UbU therefore also needs a lightweight reactive layer, likely BFS-like, policy-based, or repair-recipe-based, that starts at the current instant and maintains a short-horizon cache or reconstruction path for high-probability near-term alternatives.

The reactive layer should cover near-term alternatives involving planned Tasks, duration variation, early completion, late completion, interruptions, relevant external events, affect shifts, user overrides, eligible evergreen gap-fill suggestions, and immediate recalculation triggers. The provisional default horizon is one hour. Mobile-only, low-power, or offline operation may shorten this horizon.

When early completion creates a gap before the next Static Task and no predetermined Dynamic Task can be pulled forward, the reactive layer may compute a small ranked suggestion set from eligible gap-fillers. It should preserve the protected baseline and ask before starting or materializing the suggested Task in Phase 1.

This layer exists to let the user's current Calendar and Log update quickly when something actually happens. It should not attempt to enumerate every possible future to the end of the Calendar scope.

### 16.5 Mobile stewardship metadata

A compact Calendar should carry metadata that lets constrained devices preserve legitimacy without performing full global replanning. Useful metadata includes:

- protected, flexible, and disposable Task criticality;
- decision envelopes such as earliest start, latest finish, and movable windows;
- cached explanations for why a Task matters and what depends on it;
- conflict severity levels;
- last-legitimate-Plan references;
- simple repair recipes;
- recovery-critical and deadline-fragile markers;
- recalculation triggers and remote-assist eligibility.

The MVP-friendly subset is Task criticality, last legitimate Plan storage, simple repair rules, conflict severity levels, cached explanations, next-best-action mode, basic decision envelopes, and compact outcome-continuation refs for probable chunk-boundary outcomes. Unbounded rich branch packaging and learned local policy models are post-MVP by default.

**Phase 1b mobile stewardship schema (`UBU-D0256`).** A compact Calendar stores `mobile_stewardship_metadata` for each Task or Plan segment that mobile may recommend, move, omit, or explain. The record is compact and by reference where possible; it contains `criticality`, `decision_envelope`, `conflict_severity`, `explanation_fragments`, `repair_recipe_refs`, optional `outcome_continuation_refs`, and optional `recalculation_triggers` and `remote_assist_eligible`. Unbounded rich branch packaging, learned local policy, and global re-optimization remain outside MVP.

`outcome_continuation_refs` point to certified next-chunk continuations by boundary outcome digest, probability estimate, confidence summary, coverage scope, and stale-after value. Mobile uses them only after observed execution reaches the corresponding chunk boundary; inside the current chunk it still relies on decision envelopes, repair recipes, and escalation when local repair is no longer legitimate.

Task criticality is:

- `protected`: required for hard Calendar Logic, Static Tasks, prerequisites, dependencies, full legitimization support, recovery or safety, or a user-declared must-do commitment. Mobile must not silently drop it, shorten it below its minimum duration, or move it outside its envelope.
- `flexible`: legitimate to move, split, or shorten within its envelope when dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, and hard constraints remain satisfied. Mobile may silently repair flexible Tasks only when the resulting conflict severity is `minor`.
- `disposable`: optional or opportunistic work that may be skipped, replaced by an eligible next-best action, or left for desktop/cloud refinement when doing so does not break protected or flexible downstream commitments.

The MVP criticality object is `criticality: { level, reason_refs, recovery_critical, deadline_fragile, min_duration_seconds, user_confirmation_required, disposal_effect }`. `level` is one of `protected`, `flexible`, or `disposable`; `reason_refs` point to Objectives, Static Tasks, dependencies, preconditions, legitimization support, user commitments, or risk findings; `disposal_effect` is a short enum-or-string summary such as `none`, `lost_optional_value`, `missed_deadline_risk`, or `breaks_dependency`.

Task-level `allowed_time_range` is an admitted scheduling input for Dynamic Tasks. A decision envelope is later derived from a specific Plan placement, criticality, dependencies, preconditions, and repair policy so mobile can preserve or repair that Plan; it must not be treated as the source of the Task's allowed range.

The MVP decision envelope is `decision_envelope: { earliest_start, latest_start, latest_finish, movable_windows, min_duration_seconds, target_duration_seconds, dependency_refs, precondition_refs, affected_static_refs, affect_assumption_refs, resource_or_location_refs, repair_budget_seconds, stale_after }`. `movable_windows` is an ordered list of `{ start, end }` intervals in which the Task may begin or occupy time, depending on the Task's duration fields. Empty or absent movable windows mean the Task is fixed or must be handled by hard Calendar Logic rather than local motion.

The shared conflict severity vocabulary is:

- `advisory`: stale or degraded metadata exists, but the current and next recommendation remain legitimate.
- `minor`: a local repair inside recorded envelopes preserves all protected commitments and can be undone or inspected later.
- `major`: the current or next recommendation remains explainable, but the user must choose, confirm, or supply missing information before mobile changes a protected commitment or meaningful tradeoff.
- `blocking`: mobile cannot identify a legitimate current or next Task because a hard constraint, Static Task, precondition, dependency, affect legitimacy requirement, or required starting state is violated or unknown.

This severity vocabulary is also the Phase 1b projection-conflict vocabulary: projection-specific classes may map into these severities, but must not invent a parallel severity ladder without a later decision.

**Phase 1b projection conflict policy (`UBU-D0261`).** Projection reconciliation uses the sync conflict class `projection_conflict` with projection-specific quadrants: `known_object_edited`, `known_object_deleted`, `unknown_object_appeared`, and `expected_object_absent`. Automatic handling is allowed only when the result is deterministic, idempotent, within projection policy and decision envelopes, and does not choose between canonical user intent, protected Calendar ownership, or independently changed third-party truth.

The quadrant defaults are:

- `known_object_edited`: auto-resolvable only for non-authority metadata repair or for a permitted edit inside the object's explicit decision envelope. A duration edit to a flexible or disposable Dynamic Task may be `minor` when minimum duration, dependencies, affect assumptions, and Static Tasks remain valid; an edit that pins or moves a Dynamic Task to an external wall-clock time is `major` unless the projection policy already granted that editable window. Protected, Static, dependency-bearing, or precondition-affecting edits are `major` or `blocking`.
- `known_object_deleted`: never silently tombstones or removes the canonical object. If the object is already tombstoned, withdrawn from the projection window, or awaiting idempotent projection deletion, the absence may be `advisory`; otherwise deletion of an active canonical object is `major`, or `blocking` when current/next legitimacy depends on it.
- `unknown_object_appeared`: is contained as external evidence, import candidate, or projection diagnostic rather than admitted canonical state. It remains `advisory` or `minor` when it does not claim a user commitment or protected slot; it becomes `major` when accepting it would create or override a commitment, dependency, Static Task, or third-party-truth assertion.
- `expected_object_absent`: is `advisory` when explained by tombstone, policy/window rotation, or completed projection deletion; it may be `minor` when UbU can retry or recreate the projection idempotently without overriding external truth. It is `major` or `blocking` when the missing external object affects a protected commitment, a current/next recommendation, a required precondition, or Calendar validity.

Every automatic projection repair emits an auditable `projection_conflict_event` record with the conflict id, projection surface, quadrant, severity, canonical object ref when any, external object ref or redacted handle when allowed, observed object and policy versions, external delta digest, action taken, candidate refs when relevant, resulting mutation or projection-operation refs, and recorded time. If the action admits canonical state, it uses the ordinary mutation-envelope or tombstone path; otherwise it remains projection state, diagnostic state, or candidate metadata and is not a silent canonical mutation.

When an external delta touches the same object as a still-pending candidate, admission compares both against the candidate's observed versions before either is accepted. Exact duplicates collapse; deterministic non-overlapping deltas may update the pending candidate's provenance or candidate mutation proposal. Overlapping deltas quarantine or supersede the candidate and surface a `major` review diagnostic, escalating to `blocking` when current/next legitimacy depends on resolving it. External projection evidence cannot force a pending candidate into admitted state.

Cached explanation fragments are short, non-blaming strings with lineage refs. MVP fragments are `why_now`, `matters_because`, `depends_on`, `supports`, `legitimacy_reason`, `if_skipped`, `repair_summary`, and `staleness_summary`. Each fragment may reference Task ids, Objective refs, dependency/precondition refs, Static Task refs, risk finding refs, and compact Calendar provenance, but should avoid copying private details into more-disclosive replicas.

A repair recipe record is `repair_recipe: { trigger, applies_to_refs, eligible_when, steps, ask_policy, fallback, explanation_fragment_ref }`. MVP triggers are:

- `late_task`: condition on elapsed time and accepted Logs; keep protected Tasks and Static Tasks fixed, compress or drop only flexible/disposable work inside envelopes, then offer the next valid Dynamic Task or next-best action. Escalate to `major` or `blocking` if a protected latest finish, hard precondition, or Static Task would be violated.
- `skipped_task`: for disposable Tasks, record omission and continue; for flexible Tasks, reschedule within the envelope; for protected Tasks, ask before omission or create a blocking diagnostic if no legitimate alternate exists.
- `fatigue_report`: record the user report as a Log/Snapshot input, protect recovery-critical Tasks, reduce to protected and low-affect eligible work, and surface rest or clarification when affect assumptions no longer support the Plan.
- `approaching_static_task`: preserve the Static Task, insert required transition/setup/teardown if already modeled, stop or park the current Task when necessary, and ask when the remaining time cannot satisfy a protected current Task.
- `missing_prerequisite`: re-evaluate the deterministic precondition/dependency chain; if a modeled prerequisite Task is available, schedule or pull it forward inside its envelope; otherwise show a clarification Task or blocking prompt. Mobile must not invent a satisfied state, Resource, Skill, Technique, or external fact.

The last legitimate Plan record is `last_legitimate_plan: { plan_id, plan_digest, generated_at, effective_time, horizon, execution_profile, legitimacy_result_ref, hard_validation_ref, default_segment_digest, universe_state_digest, log_cursor, snapshot_refs, external_event_cursor, compact_calendar_digest, protected_task_refs, decision_envelope_digest, explanation_lineage_digest }`. Mobile compares current reality to this record by replaying accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, elapsed time, and user actions since the recorded cursors, then checking whether current and next Task placements remain inside decision envelopes with dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, Static Tasks, and coverage still valid.

Mobile may silently repair only for `minor` conflicts where the recipe is explicit, all changes stay inside decision envelopes, protected Tasks and support Tasks are preserved, failed preconditions are not hidden, and the explanation cache remains accurate enough for next-action display. Mobile asks the user for `major` conflicts, protected/discretionary tradeoffs, missing starting state, meaningful omission, or any repair that would change a user commitment. Mobile waits for desktop/cloud refinement or marks the Calendar stale when the issue is advisory, outside the reactive horizon, low coverage but not current-action-critical, or requires global optimization. It enters next-best-action mode when there is no safe default but there is at least one legitimate local Task or clarification Task to show.

### 16.6 Early completion and forward-pull behavior

When a Task completes earlier than expected, the default behavior should be to pull the next valid Dynamic Task forward to the present time if dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, location constraints, and other Calendar Logic allow it.

This supports a conservative duration bias: when uncertain, the scheduler may prefer duration estimates that are not overly optimistic. Early completion then becomes easy to absorb by starting the next valid Dynamic Task immediately rather than leaving useless gaps or requiring disruptive global replanning.

Static Tasks retain fixed start times. If no predetermined Dynamic Task can validly fill time before the next Static Task, the planner considers evergreen gap-fill suggestions under section 15.4 and `gap_fill_policy` rather than treating the gap as unexplained failure.

This forward-pull semantic is the natural counterpart to the log-normal duration model. Log-normal duration distributions are right-skewed: delays stack asymmetrically and early completions are relatively rare. The forward-pull repair handles early completion cheaply — no global replan, just pull the next eligible Dynamic Task forward — while late completion requires no special action since the distribution already biases toward longer-than-mean durations. For lay audiences, this is well described as a stop-light model: a sequence of independent delay sources where slowdowns accumulate and early green lights simply mean you move a little sooner. See also: `UBU-D0166`.

### 16.7 Adaptive granularity and offline operation

Compact Calendar runtime uses configurable execution profiles. The default Phase 1 presets are:

- `full_detail`: 60-second delta, 3600-second reactive horizon, `0.99` branch coverage target;
- `mobile_moderate`: 300-second delta, 3600-second reactive horizon, `0.99` branch coverage target;
- `mobile_low_power`: 900-second delta, 1800-second reactive horizon, `0.95` branch coverage target;
- `offline_steward`: 900-second delta, 1800-second reactive horizon, `0.95` branch coverage target, using precomputed branches and local repair metadata.

The one-, five-, and fifteen-minute deltas are presets, not schema constants. Calendar policy, Device policy, user settings, and runtime conditions may choose different positive deltas, horizons, coverage targets, and compute budgets. The effective values are stored with the compact Calendar or PlanningRequest so replay and explanation use the same policy inputs.

Switching to a coarser profile is allowed for `low_battery`, `low_power_mode`, `thermal_pressure`, `offline`, `expected_offline_window`, `heavy_workload`, `user_setting`, `external_worker_unavailable`, and `compute_budget_exceeded`. Returning to a finer profile is allowed when power, temperature, connectivity, worker availability, idle time, or user settings permit it. A switch records its reason in runtime or compact Calendar metadata; if it can affect the current or next recommendation, hard feasibility, affect legitimacy, or coverage threshold result, UbU records or batches a recalculation trigger using the relevant existing trigger kind.

When UbU switches to a coarser delta, the user-facing explanation must disclose the active profile, reason, effective delta, reactive horizon, coverage target or estimate, expected loss of precision, guarantees that still hold, and how to request more detailed planning or wait for a finer-capability backend.

Known offline windows trigger preparatory precomputation when connectivity and compute are available. The precompute package should cover the declared offline window plus the current reactive horizon when feasible, and should store the default Plan, last legitimate Plan, decision envelopes, Task criticality, cached explanations, simple repair recipes, and high-probability branch materialization or reconstruction instructions up to the effective coverage target. Precomputation is bounded by battery, thermal, user, Compartment, and compute-budget policy.

Unexpected offline operation degrades to cached compact Calendar state, local explicit algorithms, coarser deltas, reduced branch horizon and coverage target, simple repair recipes, and next-best-action mode. It must not pretend cloud, worker, or LLM-assisted analysis is still available.

Cached branches remain usable only while accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, elapsed time, and user actions stay inside their decision envelopes and while dependencies, preconditions, affect assumptions, and coverage remain valid. A branch expires when divergence leaves its envelope, a required dependency or precondition changes, a Static Task conflict appears, affect data becomes invalid for the Plan, coverage falls below the effective threshold, or the branch passes its recorded expiry.

The minimum mobile-only guarantee is the core UbU loop on one local device: preserve explicit state, show one recommended next Task or a clarification Task, explain why it matters now, honor Static Tasks and hard constraints conservatively, expose affect/staleness and coverage degradation, record user feedback in Logs, and run local repair for the current or next Task. Mobile may use coarser granularity, shallower branch coverage, reduced analysis depth, and fewer LLM-assisted features; it may not hide a mandatory external compute dependency.

### 16.8 GPU-aware execution backends and privacy boundary

The open-core planning loop must not depend on a hidden cloud service. Mobile-only UbU must preserve the core UbU experience, but it should do so as a real-time steward of Plan legitimacy, user agency, and next-action clarity rather than as the full global optimizer.

Cloud or external compute may improve performance, granularity, analysis depth, branch coverage, and expensive legitimization, but must not be a hidden mandatory dependency for the open-core planning loop. Solver selection should treat GPU suitability as a first-class criterion. CPU or conservative exact logic should certify skeleton validity, hard constraints, contradiction diagnostics, and explanations; GPU-capable search, simulation, scoring, and learned-model inference should handle large candidate sets, stochastic robustness, affect scoring, and premium cloud planning where available.

Possible execution backends include:

- local mobile execution;
- local desktop or laptop execution;
- Phase 2 user-owned worker devices;
- dedicated user-owned worker appliances;
- UbU corporate hosted compute;
- third-party UbU-compatible compute providers;
- future privacy-preserving compute services such as practical FHE-backed or comparable encrypted computation.

The FOSS planner and Compact Calendar representation should be backend-agnostic. Execution providers are interchangeable through explicit APIs, capability grants, Compartment policy, provenance, and user-visible routing decisions. GPU search may propose candidate Plans, but hard constraints and final Plan validity must be certified by exact or conservative validation. Cloud planning payloads should minimize PII and transmit only the structured timing, dependency, value, constraint, criticality, and legitimacy information needed for the selected provider.

**Backend trust boundary (`UBU-D0254`).** Backends beyond the controlling local instance are advisory workers behind an explicit `WorkerAuthority`; they may propose candidates, simulations, extraction or summary artifacts, projection previews, diagnostics, repair suggestions, and candidate mutations, but they do not mutate canonical state or decide their own scope. Returned artifacts are usable only after schema validation, Compartment/export admission, provenance validation, hard-constraint certification, and ordinary CPU commit or review paths.

**Phase 1b local advisory worker protocol (`UBU-D0255`).** A local advisory worker is invoked through a `LocalAdvisorySubmission` with a `WorkerAuthority`, minimized by-value payload, expected result schema, timeout, compute budget, result size limit, partial-result allowance, causal parents, policy-version refs, input digests, and provider/model configuration metadata. Its `WorkerAuthority` grants only named advisory capabilities and denies canonical writes, admission decisions, direct StateStore handles, extra context fetches, authority expansion, export-policy decisions, ungranted network/tool use, credential access, and retention past the request deadline.

A `LocalAdvisoryResult` echoes the authority, request, policy, input, provider, model, and configuration provenance and returns status `ok`, `partial`, `rejected`, `timeout`, `worker_error`, `malformed_result`, or `cancelled` with schema-valid artifacts, proposed candidates, proposed candidate mutations, diagnostics, safe telemetry, and deletion confirmation when required. Errors, timeouts, cancelled work, and malformed raw output are diagnostic records or quarantined digests, not candidate-state mutations; partial output is usable only artifact by artifact after schema validation.

The worker receives no mutable canonical-state capability. Only the controller/admission path can translate valid advisory artifacts into candidate-queue entries, projection previews, diagnostics, or candidate mutation envelopes, and those proposals remain subject to ordinary schema, policy, provenance, hard-constraint, affect/legitimacy, mutation, and user-review checks. Later remote, rented, or multi-provider workers must preserve the same authority envelope, status semantics, provenance, payload-minimization proof, input digests, retention/deletion semantics, result-size and partial-result rules, and CPU/admission certification; transport may add encryption, signatures, attestations, or sync-carried `worker_request`/`worker_result` statements but not a second mutation channel.

**Phase 1b single-Device credential custody (`UBU-D0262`).** External OAuth tokens, refresh tokens, provider API keys, client secrets, local endpoint authentication material, and worker credentials are Device-local secret values held outside the canonical StateStore. Canonical state may contain only policy metadata and opaque `SecretCapability` or secret-store handles: kind, owning integration or worker authority, operation scope, allowed `zone_id` and `compartment_ids`, version, status, retention/export class, and audit refs. This does not claim encryption at rest beyond the local platform secret store before Phase 2.

The Phase 1b controller labels a credential by the Compartments whose data or external authority it can read, write, or affect; broad provider tokens inherit the broadest applicable label. A worker or projection operation may use a credential only through the controller's credential broker when its authority envelope, purpose, policy versions, and requested operation are within that secret capability. Workers do not receive or read credential material, and a worker scoped to one Compartment cannot use a credential labelled for another.

Revocation and rotation are local capability-state changes. Revocation disables new use immediately on the Device; rotation creates a new credential version and disables the old version for new dispatch. Queued projection operations and advisory submissions record the credential capability id and version they expected; dispatch rechecks the current state and cancels, blocks, or asks for reauthorization rather than silently substituting credentials. Completed external side effects remain reconciled through projection records and conflict handling.

Credential egress is enforced by typed secret references and central serializers, not by caller convention. Projection records, worker submissions/results, canonical payloads, logs, diagnostics, store exports, backups, and diagnostic bundles must reject reusable bearer tokens, API keys, refresh tokens, client secrets, authentication headers/cookies, local secret-store lookup material, and raw credential values; at most they may include an authorized opaque capability id/version or redacted handle.

The open-core boundary includes the canonical planning schemas, Compact Calendar representation, deterministic skeletonization and precondition/effect evaluation, conservative CPU hard-constraint validation, admission and provenance checks, payload-safety validation, and enough local execution-profile support to produce a legitimate default Plan or blocking diagnostic without a hidden service. Hosted, rented, GPU, learned-model, or third-party compute may improve speed and depth, but they are replaceable request/result providers.

Routing selects the least-disclosing capable backend under policy, freshness, latency, energy, and compute-budget constraints. Mobile local execution remains the stewardship fallback for current/next Task clarity and cached repair; local desktop/laptop execution is the default high-fidelity self-hosted path when available; Phase 2 user-owned workers use the sync-carried worker protocol; corporate hosted compute and third-party UbU-compatible providers require explicit policy allowance and user-visible routing disclosure. Third-party providers receive no privileged access over local execution and must use the same authority, payload-safety proof, provenance, response validation, and CPU certification boundary as UbU-hosted providers.

Before external egress, the controller evaluates Compartment policy, export limits, Device or provider trust, `no_cloud_llm`-style constraints, retention rules, and purpose compatibility. Payloads are minimized `PlanningRequest`, `worker_request`, or derived context bundles over redacted Replicas; direct PII, stable object IDs, Compartment labels, secrets, integration credentials, and unrelated UniverseState are omitted, generalized, or replaced with redacted handles unless policy explicitly authorizes disclosure. Transport is encrypted, retention is bounded, diagnostics must not reintroduce stripped identifiers, and results echo policy versions, input digests or structural references, provider/model identity, safe telemetry, and required deletion confirmation.

Dedicated personal worker appliances are future packaging or reference hardware for ordinary user-owned worker Devices, not a separate trust class. Practical FHE-backed or comparable encrypted compute remains strategic research until it can preserve the same authority, provenance, routing, and certification boundary with stronger disclosure properties. Idle-compute monetization, if ever supported, is an external API-enabled user opt-in with revocation, policy limits, and auditability rather than an UbU corporate marketplace or default use of personal compute.

### 16.9 MVP Compact Calendar implementation

The minimum Phase 1 Compact Calendar implementation stores the legitimized skeleton baseline, the default Plan, the active execution profile, coverage estimate, uncovered-mass estimate, effective coverage threshold, decision envelopes, Task criticality, conflict severity, cached explanation fragments, simple repair recipes, probability provenance, and last-legitimate-Plan record. It stores user-previewed, risk-report, and debug/reproducibility Plans only when those artifacts are actually generated or needed for audit.

High-probability near-term alternatives within the reactive horizon may be stored as materialized branches or as deterministic reconstruction instructions. Non-selected candidate Plans, expensive global repairs, and low-probability branches are reconstructed on demand from the compact grammar, current UniverseState, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, repair recipes, and cached provenance.

MVP planning does not require exhaustive optimal search, cloud compute, GPU execution, exact coverage proof, learned policy models, or a complete transport grammar for every post-MVP uncertainty source. The required implementation is a deterministic skeletonizer, minimum legitimizer, greedy baseline, bounded candidate expansion, hard-constraint validator, Plan probability/provenance record, compact default-Plan package, short-horizon repair cache or reconstruction path, and low-coverage recalculation trigger.

### 16.10 GPU desktop execution backend

The Phase 1 performance target is a local desktop/laptop GPU backend, delivered in Phase 1b as part of the planner the switch requires (`UBU-D0275`). A small CPU reference path or fixture-backed deterministic path remains required for tests, CI, and contributors without GPU access. Cloud planner backends and the full mobile planner remain deferred beyond Phase 1. Mobile already has a smaller stewardship role; its execution profile and validation contract are specified in §16.10.6.

The implementation-facing contract for this section is `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`. `DESIGN.md` defines the architectural intent; the contract file defines the Phase 1 schema and boundary details.

#### 16.10.1 Pure function contract

The GPU planning engine is a pure function. Its input is a `PlanningRequest`. Its output is a `PlanningResponse` containing ranked PlanCandidates, diagnostics, warnings, and probability-quality metadata. The engine has no canonical side effects, performs no UbU I/O, and holds no request-semantic mutable state. The CPU kernel owns all canonical state mutation. The GPU engine is advisory only: it proposes; the CPU kernel validates and commits.

In Phase 1b the engine is invoked through a persistent local Python worker process owned by the CPU kernel (`UBU-D0283`). The boundary is local length-prefixed JSON frames over pipes, not a network service. This replaces the earlier in-process typed-call direction so the Rust desktop kernel keeps crash isolation from Python, CUDA, and PyTorch failures, avoids embedding the Python interpreter and its lock in the Rust process, and amortizes Python startup by reusing the worker. The framework is PyTorch.

#### 16.10.2 CPU/GPU handoff contract

The CPU/GPU semantic boundary is defined by two typed objects: `PlanningRequest` and `PlanningResponse`, specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`. Worker-spawn envelopes such as `GpuAdvisoryRequest` and `GpuAdvisoryResponse` may wrap those objects for process management, framing, cancellation, and telemetry, but they do not define separate planning semantics. Time values crossing the semantic boundary use the contract's RFC 3339 UTC timestamps; integer Unix seconds and tensor offsets are implementation-local lowerings.

`UBU-D0283` now records the explicitly approved internal `stage1-atomic-v1` exception: a minimized request, CPU-derived order/masks and tagged sampling source cross the stage boundary; padded structural arrays return for CPU certification. The canonical `PlanningStreamFrame` and pure semantic boundary are unchanged. The atomic profile does not implement public chunk streaming or the full response contract, and a fallback gate is not evidence of successful tensor computation.

`UBU-D0297` specifies the future worker-derived duration stream: stateless Philox4x32-10 with seed/candidate/Task/draw addressing, an exact open-unit uniform and AS241/fdlibm transform. Both implementations and near-window golden vectors must be frozen and certified before activation. The current atomic profile still receives deterministic fixed/mode placement seconds from CPU; neither the new stream nor expanded Stage 1 stochastic behavior is implemented by this design ticket. Exact duration/window/mask parity remains distinct from the unchanged named numeric/statistical profiles for later-stage scores and rollouts.

`PlanningRequest` includes schema version, planner version, request ID, effective time, generated-at time, mode, RNG seed, time-window policy, horizon policy, compute budget, task graph with CPU-provided `topological_order`, UniverseState snapshot, AffectProfile, scoring policy, constraint policy, payload policy summary, and privacy/provenance payload-safety proof. Optional fields include external event assumptions, repair context, explanation request, and debug flags.

`PlanningResponse` returns ranked PlanCandidates plus diagnostics, rejection counts, warnings, probability-quality metadata, optional coverage estimate, optional compute telemetry, and stage funnel counts. `K=3` PlanCandidates is the Phase 1 default:

- highest-utility candidate;
- most-robust candidate;
- most-schedule-diverse candidate.

K is user-configurable to allow power users to tune computational resource use. The Phase 1 default rollout budget is `n_rollouts = 1000` per finalist unless overridden by the CPU kernel's compute budget.

Interactive requests may be answered as a stream of certified chunk results followed by the final `PlanningResponse`. Batch requests return only the final response (`UBU-D0281`). In Phase 1b the worker emits framed `PlanningStreamFrame` messages: zero or more `chunk_result` frames for interactive delivery, then exactly one `final_response` frame. Each chunk result is certified by the CPU kernel on arrival before it can become user-visible.

Backend selection is CPU-owned. If policy disables GPU use, no compatible local GPU/PyTorch runtime is available, the worker fails, or the compute budget does not justify worker dispatch, the CPU reference path is used. Responses and committed Plans record backend provenance, including backend kind, invocation kind, engine version, framework, device summary when available, request id, RNG seed, tolerance profile, and CPU certification status. GPU scores and rollout estimates are reproducible within the recorded tolerance profile, not bit for bit across hardware; CPU certification and CPU reference goldens are authoritative.

#### 16.10.3 Tensor layout

All tensor batches use padded fixed-size shape `(N_CANDIDATES, MAX_PLANNING_TASKS, ...)` with an explicit boolean validity mask tensor marking valid task slots. Ragged tensors are not used in Phase 1.

`MAX_PLANNING_TASKS = 256` is the Phase 1 planning window ceiling, defined at a single site. Future premium or wide-horizon tiers may increase this ceiling by scalar configuration, subject to memory, scenario-count, correlation-matrix, validation-cost, and backend performance limits. Linear scaling is not assumed as a mathematical guarantee.

#### 16.10.4 Pipeline stages

The GPU engine has four first-class pipeline stages, with semantic boundaries specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §5`.

1. **Skeleton sampling** — parallel shifted-log-normal or fixed duration sampling across candidates with vectorized propagation over the CPU-provided topological order.

2. **`affect_legitimacy_filter`** — batch sigmoid affect-constraint evaluation across surviving candidates. This stage implements only the sigmoid affect-constraint portion of legitimization. Full legitimization in UbU design is broader: it makes a skeleton Plan human-viable by respecting affect, recovery, transition, rest, sustainability, and support constraints. The `affect_legitimacy_filter` GPU stage does not replace or subsume full legitimization.

3. **Value scoring** — parallel utility, approximate robustness, affect-margin, and schedule-diversity scoring across surviving candidates.

Phase 1b value scoring uses CPU-computed, request-local Task value/priority metadata derived from admitted pairwise Task Preferences (`UBU-D0277`, `UBU-D0282`). Objective labels, deadlines, routine cadence, and revealed-preference evidence may inform review, risk, urgency, or later policy work, but the GPU stage receives only the bounded transient values supplied in the `PlanningRequest`.

4. **Monte Carlo rollout** — joint scenario simulation for finalists using correlation-group Gaussian copula sampling with deterministic rollout seed derivation.

GPU search proposes candidates. Hard constraint certification and final Plan validity are performed by the CPU kernel using exact or conservative validation.

In Phase 1b the stages operate on chunked candidates (`UBU-D0279`, §16.3): skeleton sampling builds candidates chunk by chunk, and the Monte Carlo rollout shares its latent draws across chunks. Chunked search stays inside one planning invocation for the whole request; the worker may batch chunks internally to fit memory, but the CPU does not dispatch each chunk as a separate semantic request.

#### 16.10.5 Stochastic duration model

Task durations use either a fixed duration model or a shifted log-normal distribution. The stochastic model is parameterized by `(min_seconds, mode_seconds, p95_seconds)`.

- `min_seconds` is the optimistic lower support shift used by the planner distribution; it is a subjective best-case modeling prior, not a claim about physical impossibility.
- `mode_seconds` is the most likely duration.
- `p95_seconds` is the high-but-plausible 95th percentile, not a hard upper cap.

The shifted distribution is `D = min_seconds + LogNormal(mu, sigma)`, with the canonical conversion formula specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §3`. The planner may sample durations greater than `p95_seconds`; that is intentional.

Fixed known durations use a separate fixed-duration model and are represented as a delta distribution. Invalid stochastic triples are rejected by schema validation rather than silently repaired.

For lay audiences this is well described as a stop-light model: a sequence of independent delay sources where slowdowns stack asymmetrically and early arrivals are absorbed cheaply by forward-pulling the next eligible Dynamic Task.

#### 16.10.6 Mobile execution profile

Mobile is a real-time steward of Plan legitimacy (`UBU-D0126`, `UBU-D0256`, `UBU-D0290`). Its measured workload is deterministic skeletonization, exact hard-constraint checks, local repair recipes and a short-horizon branch cache from §16.5, explicitly not the full desktop chunked search.

The persistent Python worker in `UBU-D0283` is a desktop invocation mechanism. A mobile backend runs in process on the device; no Python runtime is shipped on device. The pure `PlanningRequest` → `PlanningResponse` semantic boundary, CPU-owned backend selection, CPU certification and recorded provenance remain unchanged. Mobile execution records `mobile_cpu` or `mobile_gpu`, `in_process_mobile`, and its own framework or compute API. The compute API is undecided pending `UBU-Q0160`'s measurement gate.

The parity rule from `UBU-D0283` applies unchanged: schema decoding, chunk partitioning, task-slot masks, dependency feasibility, hard-constraint feasibility, rejection classes and CPU-certified Plan validity agree exactly with the CPU reference path. Floating-point scores and rollout estimates use named tolerances or statistical criteria. Shared parity fixtures exercise the applicable stages; the workload benchmark remains stewardship. Every mobile-produced Plan is CPU-certified on the device before it is user-visible.

Validation uses a physically connected device over `adb`, not an AVD: emulator graphics use host rendering and cannot measure the phone's driver, vendor extensions, timing or thermal response. The rooted LineageOS device procedure and mandatory pre-flight are in `docs/MOBILE_DEVICE_TESTING.md`. No device procedure may leave the phone in a state that needs a cable to recover.

#### 16.10.7 Correlation groups and rollout matrix

Each stochastic-duration Task may carry `correlation_groups: [{group: str, strength: float}]`. In Phase 1, `strength` is a positive latent-factor loading in `[0, 1]`; negative correlations are deferred.

The CPU kernel constructs a deterministic positive semi-definite correlation matrix by normalizing per-Task positive factor loadings and computing `C = L * L^T + diag(1 - row_norm(L)^2)`. Multiple shared groups combine through the dot product of normalized loading vectors. Numeric jitter may be applied for floating-point error with explicit degraded diagnostics. Silent nearest-PSD projection is not a Phase 1 semantic repair.

Negative correlations are not rejected philosophically. They are deferred because signed pairwise-correlation declarations can create non-PSD matrices and confusing validation failures. Phase 2 should support anti-correlations through signed latent factors, explicit Cholesky-style parameterization, or a signed partial-correlation model.

The RNG seed is an explicit required input, ensuring plan generation is reproducible for peer debugging.

#### 16.10.8 Solver selection and deferred backend targets

Phase 1 does not require OR-Tools, Z3, CP-SAT, SMT, MaxSMT, or another external exact solver as a runtime dependency. The mandatory certification path is the built-in CPU kernel: dependency DAG validation, deterministic precondition and effect evaluation, skeleton validity, bounded contradiction diagnostics, full legitimization, hard Calendar Logic checks, provenance validation, payload-safety validation, and final Plan commit.

Solver and library candidates are evaluation targets:

- built-in CPU graph and precondition validator: required reference path and certification source;
- OR-Tools CP-SAT: optional finalist schedule-feasibility and contradiction-minimization experiment;
- Z3 or comparable SMT/MaxSMT: optional logical contradiction-diagnosis experiment;
- PyTorch or CPU local-search libraries: optional advisory candidate-optimization experiments;
- learned models: post-MVP advisory ranking or parameter estimation unless CPU admission certifies the output.

Phase 1 has no mobile GPU target. The required mobile fallback is CPU stewardship for current or next Task hard checks, cached last-legitimate Plan repair, decision envelopes, and simple repair recipes as defined by `UBU-D0256`.

Premium or cloud GPU planning is governed by the execution-provider boundary in `UBU-D0254`, with concrete products deferred to later provider work. Any future cloud backend must preserve the same typed `PlanningRequest`/`PlanningResponse` boundary, Compartment and export gating, payload minimization, provenance, and CPU certification on return.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

**Access within ordinary life logistics (`UBU-D0338`).** Present guided camera acquisition and voice/text/form choices as ordinary ways to capture concerns, review proposals and act on Plans. Keep UbU's primary identity as a privacy-first life-logistics system; access features are available without a disability label or special onboarding category. Describe concrete benefits and limitations for tested workflows and Device/assistive-technology combinations. Camera availability alone establishes no accessibility claim.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

**Advisory generation policy (`UBU-D0341`).** For the MVP/Phase 2 advisory boundary, the operator configures sampling behavior in the selected inference runtime. UbU adds no generic decode Settings or application-selected temperature, top-p/top-k or repetition penalties, hidden request overrides or automatic retry tuning. Existing model/endpoint selection, timeout and review seed/ceiling behavior remain; the review seed provides no cross-model or cross-runtime reproducibility guarantee.

UbU owns bounded validator-safe producer grammars (`UBU-D0302`), finite request/output and job budgets, cancellation, validation and ordinary candidate review/admission. Required grammar and resource/output-limit fields may be sent to the runtime without transferring these contracts to sampler policy. A runtime unable to meet them leaves the affected operation unavailable with an explicit limitation and eligible retry/manual route. Abort, timeout and invalid output preserve saved state and admit no generated state changes. Retries retain current authority/input bindings and finite call/time budgets; failure cannot relax validation or authorize another route.

Document each supported adapter's required grammar/limit behavior and runtime sampling configuration instructions. Pin observable sampling configuration or its digest in qualified Device/backend profiles and label unknown effective defaults explicitly. Configuration changes require affected qualification checks under `UBU-D0331`/`UBU-D0336` where applicable. Before claiming conformance, require adapter fixtures that inspect requests for absence of application-selected sampler overrides while preserving existing review seed/ceiling behavior and required grammar/limit fields; exercise abort, timeout and invalid-output paths for preserved saved state, bounded retries and unchanged review/admission requirements. These are required checks, not passing runtime evidence or a diagnosis of the Vocabulary abort.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

For Phase 2, a single-live-session sync implementation is sufficient (`UBU-D0312`), with arbitrary N Devices, concurrent offline mutations, partial replicas, and transport-independent integrity-protected statements. Direct exchanges, imported bundles, and user-selected encrypted stores share the same causality, policy, and conflict rules; no Device or transport becomes a permanent canonical authority. Full automatic peer mesh is optional. DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §26's topology research remains a freeze gate, with at least three Devices demonstrating serialized direct exchange and encrypted store-and-forward, recoverable delivery, deterministic admission/conflict handling, and Compartment-safe partial replication as specified by `UBU-D0312`.

The minimum indirect path for the first Phase 2 sync release is implemented, authenticated encrypted bundle export/import through a user-selected file store, with at least one documented external rclone or rsync copy workflow exercised before freeze (`UBU-D0313`). Manual export/copy/import is sufficient; built-in clients and background delivery are optional. Encryption and recipient authorization protect statements, payloads, and manifests before storage, while ordinary admission and Compartment policy govern every import.

**Interrupted sync recovery (`UBU-D0314`).** Maintain a durable, policy-protected recovery record throughout each exchange. Connection loss, interrupted import, or restart without an admitted final checkpoint for the declared exchange scope records `incomplete_sync_session`. End the failed live session and release its slot while preserving recovery records and queued work; other Devices may synchronize and ordinary policy-authorized offline work may continue against an explicitly stale local view.

Fully verified, authorized statements whose required causal/admission dependencies are satisfied may be admitted incrementally. Persist each admission outcome, resulting state, and deduplication metadata as one crash-consistent unit. These admissions survive disconnect, retry, and discard, subject to existing redaction/purge policy. Partial statements, unverified payloads, and items with missing required statements or dependencies remain staged; they cannot be treated as admitted mutations or supply authoritative inputs to Plans or external projections.

An integrity-protected `checkpoint` or equivalent authenticated manifest commit must bind the declared exchange scope and expected statement/payload inventory, or its content-addressed equivalent. Admit it only after all material required for this Replica's authorized replication level has been durably verified and the required dependency/admission checks have completed. Report completion only after that checkpoint admission is durable, and only for that local scope. A checkpoint cannot admit contested mutations or prove other Devices current. A lost acknowledgment leaves delivery unknown to the sender; replay cannot undo the recipient's durable admissions. Outgoing statements remain pending for an intended recipient until the sender durably records a matching authenticated acknowledgment of that recipient's durable checkpoint admission. Exchange acknowledgments directly or through encrypted return bundles; transmission, file-copy success, or local checkpoint creation is insufficient.

The recovery record tracks exchange/bundle identity, source/recipient Device references, authenticated manifest reference if available, last locally admitted checkpoint, received/missing content references, and durable per-statement admission/idempotency outcomes. Reconstruct progress after restart from durable records. Recovery storage, dependency fetches, retention, and diagnostics obey current Zone/Compartment policy; restricted views reveal neither denied payload nor Compartment identity. Retention cleanup preserves permitted causality, deduplication, and incomplete/discard outcome metadata; missing content must be retransmitted rather than assumed received.

At the next authorized connection or import, resume from durable progress, or replay the original statements if no usable cursor exists. Preserve original statement ids, content hashes, idempotency keys, causal parents, and observed versions. Recheck integrity, Device trust, actor authority, current routing/Compartment policy, object/policy versions, and dependencies before admitting pending material or disclosing retained content. Recovery records and old checkpoints grant no authority. Automatic recovery is allowed only for deterministic, idempotent, non-authority-changing cases under `UBU-D0248`; revoked Devices and review-required conflicts retain their ordinary rejection/review rules.

Offer Resume/retry and Discard through the existing policy-safe incomplete/stale-sync diagnostic, showing the last completed scope and permitted pending counts. Discard removes unfinished incoming staging and its cursor while preserving already-admitted history, locally authored queued work, and still-required policy-permitted causality/idempotency metadata; record the discard outcome. It does not emit a tombstone or undo admitted mutations. A transient interruption alone requires no blocking merge prompt. Review-required conflicts use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §17's blocking `manual_decision` diagnostic and admitted `conflict_resolution` statement. Apply DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §22's Plan invalidation/recalculation rules to admitted changes even while the exchange remains incomplete.

**Sync-state warnings (`UBU-D0315`).** Multiple Devices may remain powered on and perform policy-authorized offline work simultaneously; only live sync exchanges serialize under `UBU-D0312`. Explain this once in Phase 2 onboarding. Ordinary offline use, Device switching, peer absence, and elapsed time alone cause no modal warning or recurring notification. Time-based reminders are opt-in with a user-selected cadence.

Keep one compact, non-blocking status for the active permitted sync scope, with details on demand: last durably admitted checkpoint and its scope/time (or "No completed exchange yet"), permitted locally authored pending counts split into awaiting exchange and awaiting recipient acknowledgment, staged incoming work, and incomplete-session state with Resume/retry and Discard per `UBU-D0314`. Say "Delivery unconfirmed" for a missing acknowledgment. File-copy success and a completed local exchange never justify "All Devices are up to date". A disconnected peer's changes are unknown unless policy-permitted evidence establishes pending state; age alone proves neither new changes nor their absence.

Show an inline Plan/Calendar freshness explanation where relevant inputs may be missing or stale: "This Plan uses this Device's current view; other Devices may have changes." Identify confirmed remote pending changes only when supported by permitted evidence. Locally authored outgoing work is saved local state, not evidence that the local Plan is stale. Label protected blocks and policy-withheld items separately from exchange failures; retrying sync cannot expand visibility.

Before external projection whose relevant permitted inputs have known pending changes, an incomplete exchange, or unknown peer freshness, present an inline review: "Other Device changes may be missing. Synchronize before projection, or use this Device's current view." Offer Sync/exchange (including export/import), Continue with current view, and Cancel. Continue requires explicit stale-state acceptance once per projection operation or reviewed batch, bound to the Device, operation, payload/input and policy versions, and permitted scope. Record it under §17.0 using `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind: safeguard_advisory_bypassed`; recheck the bindings before execution. This accepts freshness uncertainty only. Current authority, Device trust, integrity, Compartment/export policy, Plan-legitimacy requirements, and `UBU-D0248`'s blocking `manual_decision`/`conflict_resolution` rules still govern eligibility. If those rules forbid execution, omit Continue. Mere interruption or missing peer contact creates no blocking merge prompt.

Coalesce advisory explanations by Device, permitted scope, condition, and material evidence. Offer Dismiss until material change or Snooze until a user-selected time; persist the local choice across views and restart while keeping status discoverable. Reopen for material changes affecting that warning, such as newly learned permitted pending statements or changed relevant Plan/input versions; snooze may also reopen at its chosen deadline. A new projection operation needs its own scoped choice. Age or restart alone cannot reopen a dismissed advisory; opt-in reminders may follow their chosen cadence. Dismissal needs no justification and is logged under §17.0 without turning the warning into a synchronized Task. Advisory suppression cannot hide a required blocking conflict diagnostic.

Generate visible text, counts, urgency, and reappearance only from evidence or derived warnings allowed at this Replica's replication level. Restricted notices use DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §23's "A protected object cannot sync to this Device." without denied payload, source object identifiers, or Compartment ids/labels; omit object-specific notices when even existence is denied. Warnings preserve intentional partial replication and never recommend powering off other Devices or switching to a single primary Device.

**Future schedulable manual review (`UBU-D0316`).** A later versioned extension may admit a shared Dynamic review Task with independent, coherent scheduling inputs and a protected conflict-episode identity. Its target is evidence to review, not admitted contested effects. Place it only in validated unaffected Calendar capacity; otherwise keep it unplaced. The diagnostic/prompt must still admit a permitted source-conflict `conflict_resolution` without review Task creation, placement, or completion. Conflicts in the Task, its scheduling/projection artifacts, or resolution workflow terminate at that diagnostic and never spawn review-of-review Tasks. Task lifecycle reconciliation follows resolution; snooze or deletion cannot clear the underlying blocker. Current authority and source privacy govern every step. The first Phase 2 sync release retains §17's diagnostic-only model until this extension's versioned contracts and behavioral gates pass.

**Task lore after Clarify (`UBU-D0317`).** After a Clarify round, persist the operator's submitted answers through ordinary admission independently of synthesis, then offer one additional local synthesis job. The Task description is readable narrative. Keep the pre-existing description, subsequent operator edits, exact questions/answers and their necessary context as separate durable per-Task source records with stable ids, versions, actor/Device/session/round provenance, effective/recorded times, hashes and privacy/retention policy. Versioned context refs are sufficient only while the referenced context remains retrievable. Corrections append records with explicit supersession links; they never edit originals. Accepted model prose is a derived revision, not independent evidence. Raw audio/video retention is not required.

The local model returns an `AdvisoryCandidate` containing proposed prose, model/template provenance, the complete source manifest/digest and a source-to-prose coverage map. Every answer, qualification, original lore statement, correction and unresolved issue must map to prose spans; every factual prose assertion must map back to sources. Equivalent repetitions may share wording. Superseded assertions retain a temporal account of the old and corrected meanings; disagreements, unknowns, declined answers and open questions remain explicit. Preserve attribution, negation, conditions, quantities and uncertainty. Unsupported inferences remain separate labelled suggestions, not synthesized lore.

Review shows the description diff and a source-by-source checklist with exact source text beside its mapped prose. Deterministic checks require complete source/span coverage, valid references, finite bounds and current bindings; structural coverage and another model's opinion cannot establish semantic fidelity. Explicit operator approval confirms readable prose preserves all source meanings and invents no facts or agreement. Offer edit, regenerate or keep the prior description; edited prose needs renewed coverage review. Recheck authority, policy, Task-description/source/candidate versions and source digest before atomically admitting the description revision and its provenance. Concurrent changes invalidate approval and use ordinary conflict review. Failure, rejection or model unavailability preserves the prior description and saved answers. Lore approval does not admit typed planner constraints or authorize external action.

Later Clarify uses admitted prose plus the source manifest, unresolved issues and correction links. Supply exact question/context/answer records for topics being revisited and make remaining permitted originals retrievable. Check the originals before treating a topic as settled; absence from a prompt is not absence of knowledge. Missing records make context explicitly incomplete. A partial Replica unable to establish the full source frontier may offer a scoped preview but cannot replace the Task description.

Declare finite storage, prompt, result and job time/call limits. Retain source history and admitted revision/provenance while the Task is retained; archival must remain queryable. Chunk long inputs along complete source records and track coverage across chunks through the final prose. If complete reviewable prose cannot fit, stop and keep saved sources rather than truncate or drop knowledge; no cloud fallback. At storage exhaustion, pause Clarify and show any unsaved input; never claim it saved or silently evict history. Rejected candidate payloads follow the ordinary minimized retention lifecycle.

Source records, synthesized prose, coverage maps and subsequent context inherit all source disclosure, routing and retention restrictions; local processing does not waive them. Reject synthesis into a Task whose destination policy cannot protect its sources. Recheck policy on every read, sync and export. Authorized redaction/purge also removes disallowed content from dependent prose, revisions and cached context; prevent reconstruction from retained derivatives. Keep only permitted minimized gap metadata, disclose incompleteness without revealing denied existence, and never claim lossless retention beyond that scope.

**Recurring-busy workaround retirement (`UBU-D0318`).** Timed expanded recurrence instances already capture as individual Tasks. Retire a temporary manual capacity blocker only for an operator-reviewed source/series and planning scope with verified replacement occupancy. Full series-level import is not a prerequisite when expanded instances cover that scope; unsupported inputs, missed/on-demand capture and incomplete coverage retain explicit residual blocking.

Record a policy-permitted coverage manifest binding the implementation revision, source/series references, capture window/cursor and completeness evidence, source and admitted input versions, planning horizon, expected busy UTC intervals, occurrence-to-Task lineage, and blocker references. Every relevant busy occurrence must map to one active capacity-bearing representation; record how any uncovered part of the blocker remains protected. Titles or coincident times do not establish occurrence identity. Repeated capture, restart and replay preserve lineage without duplicate Tasks. Moves, cancellations and series changes supersede prior active reservations through ordinary admission while preserving logged history; absence from an incomplete response cannot establish cancellation.

Fixed busy commitments use capacity-occupying Static Tasks at validated UTC start/end times and bound chunks under `UBU-D0279`. Capture counts, Calendar display and Task existence alone do not prove occupancy. Verify the CPU reference path and each enabled planner backend against expected occupied/free intervals: flexible placements cannot enter busy time, and a source occurrence, its projection and its temporary blocker cannot consume capacity twice. Distinct commitments that genuinely overlap retain their conflict rather than being deduplicated by time.

Before removal, show the exact blocker replacements and residual intervals and obtain explicit operator approval bound to the manifest and current versions. Apply them through ordinary admission as one batch, or an equivalent serialized handoff that prevents Plan certification/projection of intermediate missing or doubled occupancy. Invalidate affected Plans and certify recalculation before reuse or projection. Failure or stale inputs preserve protection and require fresh review. Retire only the identified workaround, preserving source commitments and history. Advancing the horizon or receiving material source changes requires renewed coverage checks before using affected capacity; missing, stale or policy-withheld data never proves free time. Evidence and diagnostics obey current Compartment policy; this process neither grants capture/export authority nor bypasses existing sync/projection checks.

**Measured local multimodal hardware (`UBU-D0331`).** Qualify an exact physical-hardware/software profile, separately identifying every execution-enclave Device and its capture, review, inference and optional planning roles. Pin hardware/RAM, OS build and security-update posture, drivers/runtime, model and weights digest, quantization, context/media sizes, storage/key configuration, UbU/template and policy revisions. Declare enabled sources, latency classes, concurrency, supported session duration and operating conditions. Primary mobile interaction does not select a full mobile planner or compute API (`UBU-Q0160`); capture-mode/device allocation and delivery sequence remain `UBU-Q0183`.

Before testing, freeze the scenario set, useful-outcome rubric and finite acceptance limits for quality, latency/freshness, memory/storage, battery/thermal behavior and cancellation. Use §21.1.3's ordinary interaction and text/form workflows, with synthetic or expressly consented fixtures covering visible details, exact names/values, noisy speech, ambiguity, corrections and unsupported requests. Review grounding, preserved uncertainty, fabricated assertions, correction burden and useful candidate-to-admission/next-action outcomes; transcripts, token rates and plausible conversation alone cannot pass. Count accepted, corrected, unresolved, rejected and failed outcomes separately over all trials. Numeric interaction profiles follow §21.1.4 and remain `UBU-Q0168`'s measured work.

For each proposed Device/backend/mode, run at least 30 cold-start and 100 warm trials using the pinned fixtures, plus at least 30 minutes of its proposed concurrent capture/inference/UI workload and the full maximum supported session if longer. Measure the complete capture-to-review route, including any authorized worker transfer. Record ambient conditions, charging/battery state, competing load, instrumentation and repeat procedure. Report §21.1.4's separate timings with sample counts, median, p95, maximum and misses/errors; include peak aggregate CPU/accelerator memory, model loading, buffers/caches and concurrent manual/planning work at the declared state/context limits. Report model/state/approved-artifact storage, peak scratch and required free-space reserve, energy/battery measurements and uncertainty, temperature/throttling and performance over time. Unavailable metrics stay explicit; missing evidence for a required limit prevents qualification. A short successful run cannot establish sustained or longer-session support.

Endpoint qualification must demonstrate a maintained security-update posture, installation/model integrity checks, OS access isolation, protected Device keys and access-controlled encrypted persistent storage with documented key custody and recovery. State the threat envelope: locked-device loss, unauthorized unprivileged processes, unintended persistence and unauthorized egress; do not claim protection from a compromised OS or malicious local administrator. Exercise source/Device revocation, lock/restart, denied reads/egress, storage exhaustion and interrupted cleanup. Inventory raw/intermediate/retained copies, OS/runtime swap, hibernation, crash dumps, caches and backups; enforce §12.2 and §21.1.5 on every applicable path or disable the affected mode. Encryption alone cannot satisfy transient-media retention. A rooted/debug planning-parity device supplies no endpoint-security evidence by itself; hardware attestation remains optional under DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §26, and cleanup establishes no forensic-erasure guarantee.

Publish a policy-safe support matrix linking the exact profile, enabled workflows/classes, measured usable-memory/free-storage envelope, quality and timing results, sustained operating duration, security/retention outcomes and demonstrated fallback. Test offline/model loss, low battery, thermal/resource pressure, stop/silence, delayed results and manual completion without hidden cloud routing or loss of permitted saved state. A worker on another Device needs its own qualified endpoint/profile and existing route/Compartment checks; a same-Device worker remains an execution context unless separately admitted under §23.1. Ownership grants no disclosure authority. Only profiles passing all declared limits and mandatory security/retention gates may be operator-approved for those slices; material profile changes require affected rechecks. Label the selected configuration a tested sufficient profile among the tested candidates, with failures and limitations visible; infer no universal phone minimum or local-versus-cloud quality ranking. `UBU-Q0177` stays Open until a reviewed evidence-backed profile is selected; a protocol alone cannot close it. Lower-cost reach remains `UBU-Q0178`.

**Inference runtime reuse qualification (`UBU-D0336`).** Extend the endpoint gate to the deployed runtime's effective process permissions and source-dependent state across jobs. Inventory prompt/KV caches, embeddings, decoded media, buffers, leased handles and scratch separately from verified read-only model weights. A warm process or shared weights grant no access to prior job context. Enforce §21.1.5's lifecycle before reuse; separately authorized retained artifacts enter a new job only through fresh broker access and current bindings. If safe reuse cannot be demonstrated, qualify an isolated per-job runtime or leave the affected mode unavailable.

Run paired synthetic camera-and-voice jobs A/B under distinct grants, with B denied A's source and context. Put a unique synthetic detail in A and request it from B without supplying it. Exercise both job orders, ordinary completion, cancellation and source/policy revocation, crash/restart and resource pressure; include overlapping jobs only where concurrency is proposed. Inspect B's actual supplied context, runtime reads, result/artifact releases, cache/handle lookups and diagnostics for unauthorized A content or identifiers. Probe ambient filesystem, credential, camera/microphone and network access through the runtime's actual interfaces under deployment permissions; model refusal or a configured permission declaration alone cannot establish denial. Include an authorized control supplying the synthetic detail to B through the broker to verify the detector and permitted access path. Absence of a detail in generated prose alone cannot prove isolation.

Record pinned fixture/grant versions, expected and observed access/release outcomes, runtime permission observations, reset/termination behavior and policy-safe evidence links in the qualification report. Every enabled reuse/concurrency mode must demonstrate the allowed control and zero unauthorized reads/releases in these fixtures; unobserved mandatory paths remain unqualified. Repeat the cold/warm and sustained workload measurements with the enforced isolation, reset and cache restrictions active, accounting for their time, energy and aggregate memory/storage costs. Publish limitations beside the support matrix. These fixtures supply no passing runtime, hardware selection or forensic-erasure result.

**Economically accessible local paths (`UBU-D0332`).** Compare two candidate routes for a bounded camera-and-voice slice under `UBU-D0331`:

- **Existing single Device:** bounded still-image capture and push-to-talk audio, with smaller/quantized or task-specific local models capable of CPU inference, finite context and serialized inference jobs. Evaluate supported older hardware without assuming that age, nominal RAM or model size establishes eligibility.
- **Existing personal worker:** capture and review on one Device, with bounded inference on an existing operator-owned laptop/desktop worker. Qualify both endpoints and the complete authenticated encrypted transfer route. Current Device trust, Compartment/source permissions and original consent, freshness, retention and job limits govern every copy; ownership or physical proximity grants no authority. Worker loss leaves a qualified same-Device route or useful text/forms.

Each candidate uses legally locally runnable software/weights with disclosed licenses, installation downloads and fees, and requires no hosted inference, paid API credential or recurring model-service subscription. Dedicated accelerators and continuous streaming are optional for this evaluated slice; `UBU-Q0183` retains overall release scope and sequencing. Demonstrate same-Device operation with networking disabled and worker operation with Internet access blocked. Ordinary manual entry, exact correction, candidate review, admitted-state inspection and action recording remain available with models absent under §21.1.3.

Before dispatch, show the selected route, enabled modalities, measured latency class, finite wait/context/media limits and fallback. Reduce resolution, frame count or context only within a qualified profile, retaining transform provenance and explicit missing coverage. Slower processing cannot extend raw-media deadlines or freshness, silently omit necessary detail, or weaken uncertainty, corroboration, review, admission or Plan certification. Unsupported work returns an explicit limitation and an eligible retry or manual route. Switching models, endpoints or sources requires fresh bindings and applicable consent; cost/resource pressure grants no routing authority.

Extend `UBU-D0331`'s frozen useful-outcome rubric and real-device trials with a paired comparison of these routes on the same permitted §21.1.3 fixtures and declared workload. Include at least one CPU-only inference candidate and one existing-worker candidate; unavailable or ineligible candidates remain visible. Require a visible camera detail plus speech to produce a grounded reviewable candidate, exact correction/admission and a useful next action or explicit planning limitation. Report successful, corrected, unresolved, rejected and failed trials separately, plus total workflow time and operator setup, maintenance and correction effort. A text-only fallback cannot establish multimodal reach.

Declare the comparison baseline, usage period/workload and evaluated cash, effort, energy and storage budgets before trials. Report incremental outlay for already-owned hardware separately from acquisition/refurbishment and replacement assumptions. Include necessary software/model fees, download/connectivity, measured workload energy, storage, secure upkeep and accessories for the whole route, including a worker. Price observations state date, region and currency; running-cost estimates state usage period, workload, rates and uncertainty. Distinguish measured outcomes, quoted prices and estimates; unknown required costs prevent a claim that the budget is met. Use "lower-cost" only for a specified comparator and matched useful workload, with accuracy, latency and effort tradeoffs beside cash savings. User-supplied budget scenarios establish an evaluated envelope, without inferring individual affordability or population reach.

Publish costs, effort, qualified workflows/classes and failures alongside `UBU-D0331`'s support matrix. Select a path only after the operator reviews evidence that it passes the declared usefulness, resource, cost and mandatory security/retention limits. If no path qualifies, retain useful manual operation and the explicit multimodal gap. `UBU-Q0178` remains Open until an evidence-backed lower-cost path is selected; this protocol establishes no price, device minimum or supported configuration. `UBU-Q0177` and `UBU-Q0168` retain hardware and numeric-profile acceptance; CPU inference here selects no mobile planner or compute API under `UBU-Q0160`.

**Entry cash and useful-outcome accounting (`UBU-D0337`).** Extend `UBU-D0332`'s comparison with explicit ownership scenarios: capture/review Device only, or capture/review Device plus an existing worker. Include the Device-only scenario even if its worker route is unavailable. Evaluate acquisition/replacement separately; an already-owned worker's zero acquisition outlay cannot be used in a scenario that must buy one.

Before trials, declare finite entry-cash, cash-per-budget-period and total-horizon ceilings alongside the existing effort, energy and storage budgets. Entry cash includes every mandatory payment before the first useful multimodal outcome. Show subsequent payments in the period when due, including secure upkeep and necessary replacement under the declared assumptions. Amortization or unconfirmed resale proceeds cannot make a due payment fit. State the security-support and replacement assumptions over that horizon; continued use after an endpoint's declared maintained-security eligibility ends cannot be priced as a saving. Unknown required payments prevent a budget pass.

For each measured workload, report all-attempt totals for run-related cash, energy and active operator minutes, including failures and retries, and divide each total by the number of useful multimodal outcomes. That denominator includes only successful or successfully corrected camera-and-voice workflows meeting the frozen rubric; keep those outcome counts separate. Manual-only completion after multimodal failure remains fallback and cannot enter the denominator. With zero qualifying outcomes, report per-outcome values as undefined and the workload as unqualified. Period estimates retain the observed outcome mix and disclose uncertainty; fixed entry, upkeep and replacement costs remain in whole-route totals.

Add ownership prerequisites, entry/period payment schedules and ceilings, all-attempt totals, outcome denominators and per-outcome values to the cost/support matrix, with evidence links and pass/fail/unknown for each budget and mandatory gate. Select only for scenarios whose whole-route budgets and `UBU-D0331`/`UBU-D0336` qualification gates pass. Keep any no-worker multimodal gap visible. This extension selects no measured configuration or cost envelope; `UBU-Q0178` stays Open pending operator-reviewed results.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.

- If resolving the selected question, replace the `Unresolved.` text under that selected question's `### Resolution` section and update that same question's metadata line. Do not insert selected-question resolution text into any other question block.
- Use the existing `UBU-Qxxxx` and `UBU-Dxxxx` numbering conventions.
- Prefer minimal, auditable changesets.
- If the selected question is blocked, propose decomposition only if it produces replacement questions with fewer, simpler, or no dependencies.
- If the selected question is already partially resolved, narrow or clarify it rather than pretending it is fully unresolved.

Return only JSON.
