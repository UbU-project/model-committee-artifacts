## UBU-Q0056: Game theory, strategic interaction, and counterparty modeling

Status: Open Priority: Post-MVP Phase: Phase 1b Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0025 Blocks: Strategic interaction modeling, counterparty incentives, post-MVP coordination protocols Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-09-18 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should game theory affect UbU's model of strategic interaction, counterparty incentives, commitments, and adversarial or cooperative behavior?

### Subquestions

1. Which strategic patterns can be represented through External Events and Techniques?
2. Which patterns require explicit strategic-interaction objects or counterparty models?
3. How should UbU represent credible commitments, signaling, free-riding, principal-agent problems, bargaining, and trust-but-verify workflows?
4. How should strategic reasoning interact with Identity, capability grants, Compartments, and external projections?
5. How should UbU avoid overconfident game-theoretic recommendations when the counterparty model is speculative?
6. Which strategic-interaction features are useful for FOSS coordination, skilled contributors, grants, issue triage, bug bounties, and future Skill Barter systems?

### Current direction

Many strategic patterns can be represented through External Events and reusable Techniques. Deeper counterparty modeling and strategic-interaction primitives are post-MVP research areas and should not block Phase 1.

### Resolution

Open.

## Canonical design context

The excerpts below are **not** the whole canonical files. They are the subset selected by
following references from the selected question: its dependencies, the decisions those
questions cite, and the sections those cite in turn.

Read them under these rules:

- **Absence is not non-existence.** Ids and sections you cannot see here still exist.
  Never conclude that a question is unasked, a decision unmade, or a section absent
  because it is not shown.
- **Do not renumber or reuse ids.** Allocate new entries from the next free ids below.
- **Patch context must match the real file.** Hunks are applied against the full files,
  not against these excerpts, and `git apply` locates them by surrounding context. Quote
  surrounding lines exactly as they appear here.
- **Scope your edits to what you can see.** Do not delete or rewrite text on the
  assumption that it duplicates something outside these excerpts.

Next free ids — use these for anything you add:

## UBU-D0100: Snapshots are immutable partial observed assertions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §12

Snapshots are partial observed assertions over specific UniverseState fields. They are not full assertions of all UniverseState and do not imply that omitted fields are absent, unchanged, or unknown. Applying a Snapshot updates only the fields included in that Snapshot.

Snapshot records are immutable once accepted into the append-only Log. The original Snapshot observation is never edited or deleted as canonical history. Annotation, correction, and revocation are represented by later Log entries that point to the original Snapshot observation or Log entry.

MVP confidence is stored at both levels: a required snapshot-level confidence summarizes the observation as a whole, and optional per-field confidence overrides may be present when different observed dimensions have different reliability. If a field has no per-field confidence, it inherits the snapshot-level confidence. For affect Snapshots, the existing MVP rule remains: affect confidence may be treated globally across affect dimensions, with per-dimension confidence deferred unless a Snapshot explicitly provides per-field confidence.

Conflict resolution is field-local. Latest observed Snapshot data overrides simulated state for conflicting fields. User-declared Snapshots have top priority over sensor-derived, imported, inferred, or worker-submitted observations in MVP. If two user-declared Snapshots conflict on the same field, the latest `effective_at` or Snapshot timestamp wins unless a later correction supersedes it. For non-user observations, the application algorithm may use source priority, effective timestamp, and confidence, but confidence does not defeat an explicit user declaration in MVP.

A Snapshot can be corrected or revoked, but only through a new Log entry. Correction that replaces the observed state creates a new Snapshot and links it to the corrected Snapshot or Log entry. Revocation without replacement creates a correction/revocation Log entry that excludes the original Snapshot from corrected query views while preserving the historical claim.

#### DESIGN.md §12 — Snapshots

```markdown
## 12. Snapshots

A **Snapshot** is an observed state update.

User-declared and sensor-derived observations use the same object type.

Snapshots are partial observed assertions over specific UniverseState fields. They are not full-state replacements and do not assert anything about omitted fields.

MVP snapshot fields:

- `snapshot_id`
- `timestamp` or valid-at instant
- `source`
- per-dimension or per-field values
- snapshot-level confidence
- optional per-field confidence overrides
- correction or revocation status derived from Log correction links

### 12.1 Snapshot precedence rule

- Latest observed snapshot overrides simulation on conflicting fields.
- User-declared snapshots are top-priority observations.
- Confidence is stored, but does not override explicit user declaration in MVP.
- Between conflicting user-declared Snapshots for the same field, latest effective timestamp wins unless a later Log correction says otherwise.
- Between conflicting non-user observations, source priority, effective timestamp, and confidence may be used by the Snapshot application algorithm.

Snapshot records are immutable once accepted into the append-only Log. A Snapshot may be corrected or revoked only by a later Log correction entry that points to the original Snapshot observation. A correction that asserts replacement state creates a new Snapshot and links it to the corrected Snapshot or Log entry; a revocation without replacement simply removes the original Snapshot from corrected query views while preserving the historical claim.

Social identity observations, such as group membership, role activation, self-concept statements, or mode-context salience, follow the same partial-assertion rule. A Snapshot or accepted record may assert one scoped social-identity fact without implying that omitted memberships, roles, or contexts are absent, inactive, or unknown.

Corrections and revocations remain append-only. A later user correction can withdraw, narrow, or replace a social-identity claim without editing the original historical assertion.

### 12.2 Discovery mode

**Discovery mode** is a user-selectable workflow state, not a fourth instance operating mode. It is off by default and may be started, paused, resumed, exited, or inspected by the user at any time. The UI must show active capture state, enabled sources, local/cloud routing status, retention limits, and pending-review evidence count.

Phase 1 session states are `inactive`, `active`, `paused`, `ended`, and `pending_review`. A minimal `DiscoveryEvidenceItem` is a reviewable candidate artifact with session ref, effective time or interval, source kind, signal kind, payload ref or redacted summary, confidence, Compartment or low-security label, provenance, and review status. Raw evidence is not final truth.

Allowed Phase 1 discovery inputs are intentionally narrow:

- explicit quick notes, user-selected current action, voice or text notes intentionally captured by the user, and manual start/stop markers;
- UbU app state, Task controls, Calendar or default Plan context, timers, focus state, and foreground app category or app identifier when explicitly enabled;
- configured integration events already allowed by Compartment, External Event, and External Reference policy;
- coarse motion category such as stationary, walking, transit, or driving;
- coarse user-defined location category or geofence event, not continuous raw location by default;
- device state needed for interpretation, such as screen on/off or network/offline state.

Phase 1 discovery excludes covert or broad capture by default: continuous microphone, camera, screen recording, keystroke logging, raw message bodies, raw file contents, raw GPS trails, and cross-Identity sharing are outside the default discovery input set. Any later use of those sources requires a separate explicit mode, Compartment review, routing disclosure, and user approval.

Admission rules:

- A user-confirmed actual action that reconciles a planned interval is recorded with `plan_realized`; if it completes, fails, or moots a Task, the corresponding Task lifecycle Log is also written.
- A user override of the current recommendation records `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind = system_recommendation_overridden`, `authority_source = user_override`, chosen action or Task when known, optional reason, and a `user_override` recalculation trigger when planner-relevant.
- A user-declared current state becomes a Snapshot only when it asserts observed state such as affect, availability, location category, or capacity.
- Preferences change only through explicit accepted pairwise Preference statements. Repeated behavior and inferred reasons are not Preferences.
- Task estimates, dependencies, status, Objective annotations, or Objective status change only after user acceptance or normal validated admission. Otherwise the item remains an unresolved review item.

Undetailed periods should be represented with uncertainty rather than filled in by inference. The review UI should allow `unknown`, `private`, `rest`, `interruption`, `planned Task`, `different Task`, `quick note`, `other`, and free-text correction. UbU must not infer Preference changes, Objective failure, habit patterns, or moral meaning from unknown or private time.

Before treating repeated behavior as a habit pattern, UbU must ask a clarification prompt such as: `I have seen this pattern more than once: [behavior] during [context]. Should UbU plan around it, help you change it, treat it as not a pattern, or leave it unresolved?` Valid answers are `endorse_and_plan_around`, `tolerate_but_review`, `unwanted_help_change`, `not_a_pattern`, and `leave_unresolved`.

Discovery mode preserves sovereignty by remaining visible, opt-in, source-scoped, pausable, inspectable, and correctable. Users may reject, delete where retention policy permits, mark private/unknown, correct, defer, or accept evidence before it becomes canonical state. Compartment policy, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed-device, and allowed-integration denials remain hard boundaries.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

### 1.1 Social identity boundary

Social identity theory affects UbU as a boundary discipline: an Identity may present externally, hold permissions, and own accountability, but it is not the same object as a social role, self-concept statement, group membership, Compartment, or temporary mode-switching context.

A `Role` records situational expectations or authority for an Identity. A `GroupMembership` records a scoped relation between an Identity and a group. A `SelfConcept` records user-declared first-person meaning. A `ModeContext` records the currently salient planning lens for recommendations or coordination. A `Compartment` remains the privacy, routing, retention, and export boundary. These dimensions may reference each other, but none of them implies another by default.

Group membership can affect Objectives, Preferences, disclosure, trust, and coordination only through explicit accepted records: user-declared statements, Relationship records, Compartment policy, capability grants, organizational rules, or review-accepted observations. Membership may raise the salience of an existing Objective, select an appropriate presentation, attach coordination obligations, or constrain sharing when tied to policy; it must not create inferred Preferences, loyalty judgments, trust scores, risks, capabilities, or stereotypes merely from category membership.

In-group and out-group effects are represented as inspectable contextual hypotheses or user-declared concerns, not as hard-coded judgments about people or groups. Any planner use must expose the source, scope, affected behavior, and correction path, and choices that would restrict options, disclose data, classify another person, or change coordination authority require the ordinary review and approval gates.

For Phase 3 multi-user coordination, UbU needs minimal `Group`, `GroupMembership`, `RoleAssignment`, and `ModeContext` records with provenance, confidence, scope, optional Compartment refs, and review/correction support. Learned salience, norm conflict modeling, collective identity dynamics, and social-psychology interpretation remain later research.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.
