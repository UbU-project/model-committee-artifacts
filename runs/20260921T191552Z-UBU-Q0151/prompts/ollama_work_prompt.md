## UBU-Q0151: Phase 1b decomposition Containers and segments that stay together

Status: Open Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1b Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 100 Depends on: None Blocks: Phase 1b decomposition port, reactivation of clarify and decompose Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-09-21 Scored from commit: None

Defining context: DESIGN.md §9.4, DESIGN.md §4.2, `UBU-D0274`, `UBU-D0275`.

### Question

How does Phase 1b represent a decomposed Task as a Container whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together, and how do those segments reach the planner?

### Subquestions

1. **Container record.** `ubu-core` currently holds a stub `Container { name, items }` with embedded WorkItems. Which §9.4 fields are required in Phase 1b: `container_id`, `origin_task_ref`, `mutation_reason`, `mutation_log_ref`, ordered child Task refs, lineage and provenance?
2. **Segment representation.** Are segments recorded as split points over the ordered child list, or as an explicit list of child groups? With no split points, the whole list is one segment.
3. **Gap semantics.** Quick UbU chains decomposed children with `offset_minutes`, which is only a minimum gap, so other Tasks can slide between them and scatter the checklist. Within a segment, are children strictly back-to-back, or bounded by a maximum gap?
4. **Planner handoff.** Either the orchestrator sends each segment to the kernel as one placement unit and splits it back into child steps afterwards, or the kernel contract gains a native no-gap edge. The first keeps the contract unchanged. Its duration is exact for fixed durations and a conservative sum for stochastic ones (minimum, mode, and p95 each summed), with one rollout sample per segment. The second samples each child. Which applies in Phase 1b?
5. **Constraints inside a segment.** How are children with their own static window, allowed time range, preconditions, or dependencies outside the segment handled: split the segment there, reject the decomposition, or constrain the whole unit?
6. **Proposal shape.** What is the normalized proposal of a `Decomposition` advisory candidate: ordered children with titles, durations, and split markers? How does the decomposition advisor propose natural split points, and how does review edit them?
7. **Progress and repair.** When a child finishes early or late, how does repair treat the rest of its segment?
8. **Undo.** Under §9.4 structural replacement the original Task becomes moot with `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`. What does undoing a decomposition restore, and what history is retained?

### Current direction

Segments live on the Container. The decomposition advisor proposes split points, review can edit them, and a decomposition with no split points is one segment, which reproduces the original Task's timing. The orchestrator sends each segment to the kernel as one placement unit and splits the placed unit back into child steps, so the planning kernel contract is unchanged and the CPU planner keeps checklists together before the GPU engine exists. A native no-gap edge is deferred until measurement shows that the conservative-sum approximation distorts rollout results.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-D0274: Phase 1b advisory candidates are first-class durable review objects

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.2.1. Resolves `UBU-Q0138`.

Phase 1b represents every advisory review-queue proposal as a first-class `AdvisoryCandidate`, not as an aggregate queue blob. The object has its own id, schema version, candidate kind, lifecycle state, version, target or scope refs, normalized proposal shape, payload ref or redacted summary, evidence refs or hashes, confidence, per-field provenance, origin Device and execution-context provenance, idempotency key, Compartment refs, review-visible Compartment label or redacted label, disclosure and retention policy, review order metadata, and correction, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, admission, or archive links. Per-object representation is required so candidates can be versioned, partially replicated, redacted, and reviewed without leaking unrelated queue contents across Compartments.

The advisory candidate lifecycle states are `proposed`, `deferred`, `resurfaced`, `admitted`, `rejected`, `superseded`, and `archived`. Candidates begin as `proposed`. Proposed candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred, superseded, or archived; deferred candidates may resurface only through a justified trigger or may be rejected, superseded, or archived; resurfaced candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred again, superseded, or archived; admitted, rejected, and superseded candidates remain historical records and may later be archived under retention policy.

Before admission, candidates may influence only review surfaces: ordering, grouping, explanations, deduplication diagnostics, clarification prompts, local suggestions, and explicitly labeled preview diffs. They must not mutate Tasks, tags, dependencies, decompositions, clarification answers, Preferences, Logs, Snapshots, Plans, Calendars, Relationships, Associations, projection state, capability grants, disclosure policy, external messages, or external actions, and they must not become hidden planner constraints. Enforcement is structural: admitted-state reducers, planners, projection writers, and mutation call sites consume admitted canonical objects or explicit preview inputs, while candidate access stays behind review APIs that preserve candidate-state labels and Compartment policy.

Deferred candidates resurface only on materially new evidence, user request, policy-triggered review interval, relevant accepted change to the candidate target or dependencies, or arrival of a clarification or external reference that directly changes reviewability. A resurfaced candidate links the prior deferral, trigger evidence, and resurfacing reason, creating a new review item without promoting the candidate automatically.

Rejected candidates retain durable correction metadata rather than the rejected content indefinitely. The suppression record contains candidate kind, normalized proposal shape, target and scope shape, Compartment and redaction class, evidence hashes or source fingerprints, extractor/model/schema version, prompt/template digest when relevant, rejection reason or user correction, deciding actor Identity, `authority_source`, decided-at time, retention or purge policy, and suppression key. The rejected payload may be purged or redacted when the suppression record is sufficient; the suppression record must not make the rejected proposal true, accepted, exportable, more visible, or eligible as evidence for admitted state.

Admission, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, and archival decisions are first-class review events. Each carries actor Identity, `authority_source`, origin Device, observed candidate version, observed policy versions when policy is relied on, effective and recorded times, idempotency key, and links to resulting canonical mutations, suppression records, or replacement candidates. Admission emits the ordinary sync-ready mutation envelope for the admitted object change, while rejection records the decision and suppression key without creating the proposed canonical state.

Review ordering does not affect state category. Proposed and resurfaced candidates may be prioritized for operator attention, while deferred, rejected, superseded, and archived candidates are normally out of the active queue except for audit, resurfacing, or deduplication. A contested region remains `candidate_state` or `pending_state` until the relevant admission or conflict-resolution event is admitted, so no UI, API, preview, report, or planner surface may present advisory material as `admitted_state` merely because it is high priority, repeated, old, or uncontested in the queue.

## UBU-D0275: Phase 1b runs through the switch, the planner precedes sync, and later phases are renumbered

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4, §4.2, §4.7

Phase 1b is the phase in which mainline UbU reproduces the practical features of Quick UbU, the dogfooding user's working personal planner, so that Quick UbU can become legacy software. Its exit criterion is the switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU. Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data.

The switch requires planning that places routine and decomposed work better than the greedy baseline, so the planner belongs to Phase 1b. In addition to the feature ports, Phase 1b therefore includes decomposition into Containers (§9.4) whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together; an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks; partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend of §16.10, which was already the Phase 1 performance target and is delivered in Phase 1b together with its CPU reference path. Calendar-style recurrence (§7.4.1) moves to Phase 1b with this decision. The Phase 1b slice of recurrence and Task synthesis is carved out of `UBU-Q0125` when the Phase 1b planner questions are recorded.

The planner precedes multi-device sync, which remains Phase 2. Neither constrains the other. The planning engine is a pure function over `PlanningRequest` and `PlanningResponse` (§16.10.1) and never sees replicas, Devices, mutation envelopes, or Compartments; sync carries canonical state and the Plan artifacts already specified for Phase 1. Sync is not needed for the switch, because the dogfooding configuration is one desktop Device with Google Calendar as a projection surface, which is not a Device (`UBU-D0257`). Building the planner first shortens the path to the switch, starts full dogfooding of mainline sooner, and returns time to the user through more efficient daily planning.

Later phases are renumbered to remove lettered subdivisions:

| Label before `UBU-D0275` | Label after |
|---|---|
| Phase 3A | Phase 3 |
| Phase 3 | Phase 3 |
| Phase 3B | Phase 4 |
| Phase 4+ | Phase 5+ |

Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 1b, Phase 2, Phase 3+, and Post-MVP keep their labels and meanings. Earlier tickets, commits, and external documents that use the old labels are read through this map.

A phase label names the phase that implements an item. Pulling an individual item forward, as the Phase 1b rule does, re-tags that item to the implementing phase and never renumbers phases. Build order follows the phase table in §4.7.

Consequences:

- `DESIGN.md` §4 gains a Phase 1b section (§4.2) and a phase map (§4.7); Phase 2 and Phase 3 move to §4.3 and §4.4, and Phase 4 and Phase 5+ receive §4.5 and §4.6.
- The `model-committee` phase vocabulary adds `Phase 4` and `Phase 5` so that Open Questions can carry the new labels.
- Phase 2 sync scope, the Device Sync and Compartment contract, and all Phase 1 and Phase 1b decisions are unchanged.

Phase labels name the phase that implements an item. The phases, their build order, and the mapping from labels used before `UBU-D0275` are recorded in §4.7.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Single-user GitHub dogfooding

A single user uses UbU to coordinate development of UbU itself.

Primary goals:

- import or observe GitHub issues, PRs, reviews, CI events, and milestones;
- represent them in UbU’s Objective/Task/Calendar model;
- generate useful Plans;
- provide a minimal bootstrap interview that creates an initial dogfooding context, current or stale affect Snapshot, and prioritized Objective/Task seed set;
- provide a next-action focus mode that shows one recommended next Task with an inspectable explanation of why it matters now;
- update GitHub as a low-dimensional projection of UbU state;
- expose limitations and open questions through dogfooding.

The frozen Phase 1 implementation set is:

- local single-user `user_mode` instance for UbU-runs-UbU;
- bootstrap interview and explicit seed model creation;
- GitHub issue, PR, review, CI, milestone, and comment import from live data or approved fixtures;
- ExternalReference-style source links sufficient to trace imported GitHub objects;
- Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, and External Reference schemas only to the depth required by the dogfooding loop;
- schedulable Static and Dynamic Tasks with Objective links, durations, dependency/precondition/effect fields, active/completed/failed/moot lifecycle handling, and moot reason codes sufficient for the demo;
- lightweight UniverseState facts, affect Snapshot handling, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation;
- append-only per-instance Logs with correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries;
- Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation;
- next-action focus mode with start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, explain-more, and feedback controls;
- derived risk and human-complete plan-quality reports covering deadline risk, dependency fragility, worker or automation bottlenecks, stale affect, affect-margin, destructive pressure, and post-plan depletion warnings;
- minimal Compartment guardrails for `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed integration/device references, low-security labeling, and logged boundary decisions;
- Automation Worker identity, scoped capability grants, explicit assignment/status display, and mutation or projection request submission without direct canonical writes;
- Delegation Substrate-compatible Task formalization fields where needed for dogfooding, worker assignment, or solo self-reminder clarity, including purpose, executor type, authority, expected output, evidence, review, privacy scope, and escalation notes;
- clearly marked GitHub projection previews or human-approved writes for UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, plus reconciliation reporting;
- manually structured Release Outreach Pipeline work items and artifact records for release notes, screenshots, scripts, and contributor calls-to-action;
- manually structured EthConf outreach notes and follow-up artifacts that dogfood Association formation and organizational introspection without requiring full multi-user Association automation.

Phase 2 explicitly defers:

- multi-device local-first sync;
- partial replication across Devices, Zones, or Compartments;
- secure cross-device Compartment propagation;
- sync conflict handling;
- cross-device worker or enclave coordination beyond the single local instance boundary.

Phase 3 is the bridge from the bootstrap MVP toward the full personal life-logistics product. It prioritizes minimal Resource/Skill-aware task readiness, private skill-tree foundations, and narrow Identity coordination that directly improves single-user life logistics. Phase 4 (§4.5) begins the full version 1.0 release track, and Phase 5+ (§4.6) continues it.

Phase 3 explicitly includes:

- minimal Resource objects and Task resource requirements sufficient to answer whether a Task is realistically ready to start or complete;
- minimal Skill objects and Task skill requirements sufficient to answer whether the user can perform a Task, needs a refresher, should learn a prerequisite, or should consider purchase/delegation;
- minimal cross-user contextual messaging between UbU instances;
- user-to-user Identity-mediated requests, status updates, questions, commitments, and blockers;
- bounded Message Context Envelopes carrying priority, interrupt recommendation, topic, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, and disclosure policy;
- legacy-message ingestion and limited upgrade paths where both parties use UbU;
- user-to-user Identity commitments, capabilities, and limited disclosure sufficient for narrow coordination;
- early Delegation Substrate use between Identities, if Phase 2/3 authority and privacy boundaries are in place.

Phase 3 still defers:

- full inventory management, full financial management, bank syncing, investment tracking, receipt OCR, tax categorization, and Quicken-like accounting workflows;
- public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and marketplace governance;
- shared global project truth between users;
- rich subjective Relationship-model exchange;
- full Association synchronization;
- multi-party governance, invitation, revocation, or trust protocols;
- broad personal-data ingestion beyond selected communication integrations.

Phase 1 keeps these abstractions documented for compatibility but does not implement them:

- Technique as a first-class planning object;
- Resource and Skill as first-class planning objects beyond lightweight compatibility placeholders;
- full Compact Calendar planner grammar and high-coverage transport format;
- complete Zone and Device system beyond the current local execution enclave;
- organization-mode and worker-mode web admin consoles;
- richer relationship-management, personal CRM, and longitudinal affect/growth models;
- full Release Outreach Pipeline video generation, rendering, and publication workflow;
- broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion outside narrow approved dogfooding fixtures;
- full realtime multimodal capture, always-on assistant behavior, public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and General Contractor subdelegation workflows;
- adaptive model-committee weighting, automatic patch application, GitHub mutation, and direct cloud-provider APIs.

Stop rule:

> A new abstraction may be added to Phase 1 only when it is required to complete the single-user GitHub dogfooding loop, enforce an accepted hard invariant, or avoid a known irreversible schema contradiction. Otherwise it must be documented as a Phase 2, Phase 3, or post-MVP concern and must not block Phase 1 implementation.

After `UBU-D0175`, new MVP blockers are allowed only when discovered during implementation of a concrete Phase 1 slice and accompanied by a blocker certificate naming the blocked object or file, failed acceptance criterion, unsafe fallback, minimum answer needed, and persistence impact. Phase 1 readiness is judged slice-by-slice rather than by global philosophical completion of the model.

### 4.1.0 Phase 1 readiness scoring

Phase 1 readiness is a derived, evidence-backed, human-reviewed signal. It reports `scope_freeze_readiness` and `mvp_readiness` from per-slice evidence, gates, and score caps rather than from raw open-question count or model confidence. Unresolved nonblocking questions do not reduce Phase 1 readiness after `UBU-D0175` unless they carry a valid blocker certificate. Model-committee may compute readiness reports and propose README readiness text, but it must not publish or update public readiness signals automatically. The accepted rubric is `UBU-D0189`.

The minimum dogfooding loop that proves UbU’s core model is:

1. bootstrap the operator, project context, available work window, constraints, and current or stale affect Snapshot;
2. import or load a curated UbU GitHub fixture with issues, PR/review/CI signals, milestone context, and source links;
3. map those inputs into Objectives, Tasks, External Events, Logs, UniverseState facts, and External References;
4. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
5. present one recommended next Task with an explanation of Objective value, dependencies, deadlines, affect constraints, worker status, and risk findings;
6. record completion, failure, snooze, rejection, decomposition, or override as Log evidence and trigger recalculation when appropriate;
7. preview or perform a human-approved UbU-managed GitHub projection update;
8. show a reconciliation or risk summary that makes the changed model inspectable.

### 4.1.1 Phase 1 public demo criteria

The Phase 1 public demo should use real UbU GitHub issues or a frozen fixture captured from real UbU GitHub data when live access is unsafe, unavailable, or non-reproducible.

The smallest persuasive demo is an end-to-end single-user dogfooding loop:

1. import a curated set of UbU issues, PR/review/CI signals, and milestone context;
2. map those inputs into Objectives, schedulable Tasks, External Events, and traceable source links;
3. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
4. show why the Plan was chosen, including dependencies and worker assignment or worker status;
5. show user-mode affect constraints by applying a current affect Snapshot or by creating an affect-collection Task when affect data is stale or missing;
6. write or preview clearly marked UbU-managed GitHub projection labels, comments, or managed blocks;
7. show a risk summary covering at least deadline risk, dependency fragility, and worker or automation bottlenecks.

The demo must not require Phase 2 sync, Phase 3 multi-user coordination, full RBAC, a complete Compact Calendar UI, or autonomous remote GitHub mutation. If live GitHub writes are unsafe for the public recording, a dry-run projection is acceptable only when it shows the exact payload that would be written after human approval.

### 4.1.2 Phase 1 user-facing loop

Phase 1 must include a minimal first-person UX loop for dogfooding. The loop is intentionally narrow: it collects explicit answers, creates explicit UbU objects, recommends one next Task, records what happened, and recalculates from Logs and current state.

1. **Bootstrap interview**
   - Ask exactly the minimum questions needed to seed the first dogfooding Plan:
     1. `What are you trying to move forward right now?`
     2. `Which project context should UbU use for this first session?`
     3. `How much usable time do you have for the next work window?`
     4. `Is there a deadline, meeting, release target, or external event that changes what matters today?`
     5. `What work should UbU consider first?`
     6. `What is already blocked, unavailable, or not worth recommending right now?`
     7. `How are your energy, stress, and mood right now?`
     8. `When choosing between useful work, what should UbU favor today?`
   - Record the project/context answer as UniverseState facts and source-linked Logs.
   - Record available time, static commitments, deadlines, and immediate constraints as UniverseState facts, Tasks, External Events, or Logs.
   - Record affect answers as a user-declared Snapshot, or create an affect-collection Task when the user skips or the data is stale.
   - Record favored tradeoffs as Preferences only when the user accepts an explicit Preference statement; otherwise retain them as Log notes or Objective annotations.
   - Seed a small Objective/Task set from user answers plus approved GitHub fixtures or configured imports.

2. **Minimum data for one recommendation**
   - A user or operator Identity.
   - At least one active Objective.
   - At least one active schedulable Task linked to that Objective with title and duration or work-window estimate.
   - A current work window or next available time.
   - Current or explicitly stale affect state.
   - Known hard blockers, deadlines, dependencies, and source references for the recommended Task when available.
   - If this minimum is missing, the next recommended Task should be a clarification, import, or affect-collection Task rather than pretending to optimize.

3. **Plan generation**
   - Generate a candidate default Plan from explicit modeled state.
   - Preserve inspectability of the full Plan.
   - Explain relevant Objective value, constraints, dependencies, deadlines, risk findings, worker status, and affect constraints.
   - Mark any fixture-backed, hardcoded, or mock recommendation path directly in the UI and run artifact.

4. **Calendar preview**
   - Treat Calendar preview as a notable recurring Task.
   - Default cadence is before the first recommended Task in a user-declared work window and after a material Calendar regeneration when UbU is about to rely on the new default Plan.
   - Let the user inspect the candidate Calendar or default Plan before relying on it.
   - Ask whether the Plan feels plausible, motivating, humane, and consistent with the user's current context.
   - Ask only lightweight model-repair questions about expected execution, perceived control, social pressure, and missing context; store raw psychological comments as review notes unless the user accepts a concrete canonical update.
   - Allow the user to correct Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, affect Snapshots, availability, or estimates before execution.
   - Let the user snooze, skip, or adjust Calendar-preview cadence through the cadence rule on its evergreen system Objective (§7.4.1).

5. **Next-action focus mode**
   - Present one recommended next Task as the default UI surface.
   - Show title, Objective link, estimated duration or work window, current status, and source/provenance label.
   - Show `why this matters now` with at least the served Objective, timing reason, main dependency or blocker status, affect/staleness status, and top risk or opportunity considered.
   - Show what UbU considered, including visible counts or links for candidate Tasks, blocked Tasks, hard constraints, affect constraints, worker/projection state, and imported or fixture sources.
   - Provide controls for start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, override, and explain more.
   - Keep full Plan inspection one action away through a Plan drawer, timeline, or inspector that shows ordered Tasks, assumptions, source links, and explanation fragments.
   - One-task focus reduces cognitive load; it must not hide the Plan, turn the recommendation into opaque automation, or imply that the user has committed to the default Plan.

6. **Feedback, Log review, and recalculation**
   - After `done`, ask whether completion matched the estimate, whether the modeled effect happened, and whether energy or stress changed enough to update the Snapshot.
   - After failure or blocked execution, ask what assumption failed: missing dependency, wrong duration, stale affect, interruption, unclear Task, changed priority, or other.
   - After snooze, ask for the next review time or condition and whether the reason is timing, affect, dependency, or user preference.
   - After rejection, ask whether the Task is wrong, not valuable now, blocked, too large, already done, duplicate, or should become moot.
   - After override, record the chosen Task or action, the reason if supplied, and whether the override should update Preferences, availability, Task estimates, Objective status, or only this Plan.
   - Treat Log review as a notable recurring Task. Default cadence is at the end of a work window or at the next startup when there are unreconciled deviations, with a weekly catch-up if routine review is skipped.
   - Store reviewed outcomes as canonical updates only when they change Logs, Snapshots, Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, or recalculation triggers; otherwise keep autonomy, competence, relatedness, attitude, subjective-norm, perceived-control, and expected-execution comments as noncanonical review notes or derived report inputs.
   - Record outcomes as Logs and trigger recalculation when the outcome changes Task status, availability, affect state, dependencies, Objective status, or user Preferences.
   - Treat failure, rejection, override, and deviation as model evidence, not user blame.

7. **Discovery mode when appropriate**
   - Allow the user to choose discovery mode at any time.
   - Show active, paused, ended, and pending-review state, enabled sources, routing or retention limits, and evidence count.
   - Provide pause, resume, exit, inspect, reject, delete, and review controls.
   - Collect only enabled Phase 1 evidence such as quick notes, user-selected current action, Calendar context, configured integration events, coarse motion or location category, focus state, and app-state category.
   - Treat inferred observations as reviewable evidence, not final truth; defer ambiguous interpretation until Log review or user-visible reconciliation.

The Phase 1 version may be simple and fixture-backed. Fixture behavior must be labeled as fixture behavior, mock recommendations must not be described as implemented planning, and public demos should show the exact boundary between explicit UbU objects, approved fixtures, and implemented planner behavior. The public demonstration pattern is bootstrap, one recommended next Task, explanation, user feedback, recalculation, and full-Plan inspection. It does not require broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion. It must not claim complete life-modeling, therapeutic authority, autonomous life coaching, complete planning automation, full privacy isolation, Phase 2 sync, or Phase 3 multi-user coordination. The purpose is to demonstrate the core UbU experience: one meaningful next action, with an explanation, grounded in explicit state.

### 4.1.3 Release Outreach Pipeline dogfooding

The Release Outreach Pipeline should become part of ordinary UbU-runs-UbU release management. A minor release should produce a release outreach package when the current project state contains enough user-visible, developer-visible, or contributor-visible change to justify public explanation.

The Phase 1 package is manual but structured. Minimum package artifacts are:

- `manifest.json` with release, source, Identity, Compartment, status, and hash metadata;
- `claim_register.json` with audience, support status, evidence refs, and review state for each public claim;
- `evidence_index.json` for source artifacts, hashes, selectors, and provenance;
- release-note, script, narration/caption, announcement, and publication-metadata drafts when relevant;
- `media_refs.json` for approved screenshots, UI-test exports, fixture captures, or recordings;
- `export_review.json`, `approvals.json`, and `publication_plan.json`;
- known-limitations, future-work, and contributor call-to-action notes tied to real artifacts.

Media provenance records must distinguish approved live captures, approved fixture/synthetic captures, UI-test exports, and mock/demo-only captures. Every claim in scripts, release notes, and public posts links to claim-register evidence and uses the support labels accepted in `UBU-D0180`.

Phase 1 dogfooding may generate text drafts, collect approved screenshots or recordings, assemble a publication plan, and record human approvals. It may use local renderers or LLM/script workers only as Automation Workers that produce candidate artifacts under capability grants.

Post-MVP work includes automatic UI capture generation, demo-flow export, script drafting from repository state, narration and caption generation, thumbnail generation, video rendering automation, platform upload, social posting, mailing-list publication, analytics feedback, and trusted auto-publication policies.

The full video-generation and publication pipeline remains future work. Phase 1 should generate reviewable communication artifacts before trying to automate external publication.

### 4.1.4 EthConf outreach as Association-introspection dogfooding

EthConf outreach is a Phase 1 dogfooding workflow for Association formation and organizational introspection.

Phase 1 represents the workflow with ordinary Objectives, Tasks, Logs, External Events, External References, Release Outreach package artifacts, public dogfooding review packages, and manually reviewed candidate AssociationAttestations. It does not require full Association automation, multi-user Association sync, automatic contact analysis, or broad message/archive ingestion.

Minimum evidence set:

- canonical design files and accepted decisions;
- public dogfooding artifacts such as model-committee review packages, selected patches, issue fixtures, release outreach packages, and public retrospectives;
- structured EthConf outreach notes with private details separated from redacted public summaries;
- follow-up Tasks, missed follow-ups, public replies, contributor/funder/design-partner next actions, and outcome Logs.

Minimum outputs:

- candidate AssociationAttestations about declared project mission, outreach commitments, observed follow-through, and evidence gaps;
- mission-alignment questions, especially whether outreach behavior supports the privacy-first self-governance, contributor-recruitment, workflow-discovery, and compatible-funding goals;
- priority-drift observations and commitment-mismatch notes;
- follow-up Tasks with owners, review dates, evidence refs, and public/private disclosure labels;
- redacted retrospective notes suitable for public dogfooding artifacts.

The core review prompt is: `Does UbU's actual outreach behavior prove, from reviewable evidence, that the project pursued its stated goals?` The answer may be yes, no, mixed, or insufficient evidence, and must cite evidence or gaps rather than model confidence alone.

Public artifacts expose only redacted summaries, evidence selectors, hashes, public links, reviewed claims, and approved follow-up Tasks. They must not expose private notes, raw contact details, unapproved conversation content, private funding terms, private relationship hypotheses, or Compartment-protected payloads.

Acceptance criteria: the workflow produces one evidence-backed retrospective, at least one candidate AssociationAttestation or explicit no-evidence finding, at least one mission-alignment question, any needed follow-up Tasks, an export review, and a public-safe redacted artifact that labels fixture/manual/LLM-assisted content. A human reviewer must be able to trace each public claim to evidence or to a recorded evidence gap.

### 4.1.5 Optional VoxPopuli EthConf demo

UbU may optionally demonstrate a **VoxPopuli** flow at EthConf if it does not displace higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, or funder deliverables. In this flow, a user speaks freely about what they wish would happen or what feels disorganized. An LLM-assisted extractor converts that natural-language input into candidate Objectives, Tasks, constraints, preferences, and planning assumptions for the user to inspect, correct, accept, or reject.

VoxPopuli is a trust-building outreach hook, not a replacement for the narrow Phase 1 bootstrap interview. It should demonstrate how LLMs can help structure abstract human concerns while UbU remains the explicit, inspectable planning system.

### 4.1.6 Phase 1 implementation priority order

Phase 1 implementation proceeds in this priority order:

1. Remove all in-memory orchestrator state (`MemoryState`) and fully implement `ubu_store` as the canonical local admission and persistence path for the running loop.
2. Log event vocabulary: correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries.
3. UniverseState facts.
4. Affect Snapshot content, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation.
5. Structured bootstrap interview with seed Objective, Task, and Snapshot creation.
6. Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation.
7. Activate `ubu_github_adapter` as a functioning orchestrator dependency for import, projection preview, approved writes, and reconciliation.

The remaining §4.1 frozen-set items follow in bootstrap-dependency-driven ordering: persistence and vocabulary precede the features that must reference them.

**Phase 1 realization (`UBU-D0241`).** Step 3 (UniverseState facts) is foundationally realized, together with the accepted mutation vocabulary and deterministic precondition evaluation named in step 4, implemented as the §11 container and pure `ubu-core` semantics and persisted by `ubu-store`. The precondition, effect, and bootstrap-fact wiring of these facts into the loop is realized across Wiring-A/B/C (`UBU-D0242`): preconditions gate planning, a completed Task's effects mutate the facts, and the bootstrap records the initial facts under the `UBU-D0243` namespace convention. Step 4's affect-Snapshot content and step 5's interactive bootstrap interview remain.

### 4.2 Phase 1b: Quick UbU merge through the switch

Phase 1b extends the Phase 1 system until it can replace Quick UbU, the separately developed personal planner that serves as the dogfooding user's working daily tool, so that Quick UbU becomes legacy software (`UBU-D0275`).

Exit criterion:

> The switch: the dogfooding user's primary daily planning runs on mainline UbU.

Until the switch, Quick UbU remains the primary tool and mainline is exercised against non-primary test data.

**The Phase 1b rule.** Every Quick UbU feature merged into mainline adopts the restrictions, forms, and functional boundaries of the MVP design it corresponds to, even when that design's implementation phase is later. Open questions that block Phase 1b are answered during Phase 1b whatever phase they were previously tagged, and the items they pull forward are re-tagged Phase 1b.

Phase 1b includes:

- the Phase 1b foundations already decided, including sync-ready mutation envelopes, the Device registry, tombstones, redacted Handles, projection-conflict repair, Device-local credentials, the local advisory worker, advisory batches, and first-class advisory candidate review;
- the Quick UbU practical features, ported under the Phase 1b rule;
- the planner the switch requires: decomposition into Containers whose ordered child Tasks are grouped into segments that stay together (§9.4); an allowed time range on Tasks; Task value and priority inputs to Plan scoring; routines as evergreen-Objective recurrence that instantiates Tasks (§7.4.1); partial placement when not every Dynamic Task fits the planning horizon; and the desktop GPU backend with its CPU reference path (§16.10).

Phase 1b defers multi-device sync and everything else assigned to Phase 2 and later.

### 4.3 Phase 2: Single-user multi-device synchronization

A single user runs UbU across multiple Devices / execution enclaves.

Phase 2 validates:

- local-first sync;
- partial replication;
- Zone and Compartment boundaries;
- device roles;
- conflict handling;
- user-owned worker execution on the user's laptop, desktop, or other trusted personal compute device.

Design rubric:

> Phase 2 should feel like multi-agent coordination, but all agents happen to agree.

A Phase 2 personal worker is not a mandatory cloud dependency. It is an optional execution backend for a user's own UbU instance. It may provide more CPU, GPU, memory, storage, network availability, or battery-independent runtime than the mobile device while preserving the user's practical control over the compute environment.

### 4.4 Phase 3: Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination

Multiple humans coordinate through explicit Identities, capabilities, limited disclosure, and commitments.

Phase 3 should enable coordination without surveillance or shared global truth.

### 4.5 Phase 4: Version 1.0 release track

Phase 4 begins the full version 1.0 release track. It expands Resource and Skill usability, Technique-database integration, DIY-versus-purchase/hire planning, and the user-facing capability graph without requiring the public Skill Barter marketplace.

### 4.6 Phase 5+: Version 1.0+ release track

Phase 5+ continues the full version 1.0+ track with mature inventory, financial-management extensions, public or federated Skill Barter, reputation/evidence, dispute workflows, and other multi-party marketplace features.

### 4.7 Phase map and build order

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | ETHConf NYC demo | Complete |
| Phase 1 | Single-user GitHub dogfooding (§4.1) | Feature-complete |
| Phase 1b | Quick UbU merge through the switch, including the planner (§4.2) | In progress |
| Phase 2 | Single-user multi-device synchronization (§4.3) | Next |
| Phase 3 | Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination and Resource/Skill task readiness (§4.4) | Planned |
| Phase 4 | Version 1.0 release track (§4.5) | Planned |
| Phase 5+ | Version 1.0+ release track (§4.6) | Planned |

Phases are built in table order. A phase label names the phase that implements an item; pulling an item forward re-tags that item and never renumbers phases (`UBU-D0275`). Labels used before `UBU-D0275` map as follows: Phase 3A becomes Phase 3, Phase 3B becomes Phase 4, and Phase 4+ becomes Phase 5+.

#### DESIGN.md §9.4 — Container

```markdown
### 9.4 Container

A **Container** groups WorkItems.

Containers are not directly scheduled in Plans. Plans contain Tasks.

A Container may represent:

- decomposed work
- preempted work
- Technique instantiation
- grouped child Tasks
- Super Automation workflow structure

Container completion is derived from child states.

A Container is complete when all child Tasks are either:

- completed
- moot

Task-to-Container mutation is a structural replacement, not an in-place type change. The original Task handle remains a historical Task handle and is not reused as the Container handle.

Mutation creates a new Container with a new `container_id`. The Container records `origin_task_ref`, `mutation_reason`, `mutation_log_ref`, child WorkItem refs, and lineage/provenance sufficient to trace the restructuring.

All child Tasks created by decomposition, preemption, retry, or worker expansion receive new Task handles. Existing child or continuation Tasks may be linked into the Container, but the mutation operation does not reassign the original Task handle to a child.

The original Task transitions to `moot` with reason code `replaced_by_new_plan_structure` when decomposition or regrouping preserves the underlying intent. If responsibility moves to another executor without decomposition, `delegated` may be more accurate; if a newer source artifact replaces the Task, `superseded` may be more accurate.

Fields that describe the original intent stay on the Container or its lineage metadata: title or summary, served Objective refs, parent/dependency context, external-reference lineage, Compartment/security labels, authority/provenance, and notes needed to explain why the work was split.

Fields that make a schedulable action executable belong on child Tasks: duration or duration PDF, preconditions, effects, executor/delegation fields, worker assignment/status, expected output, evidence requirements, and any child-specific dependencies or deadlines. Child Tasks may inherit or narrow Objective refs, Compartment refs, authority source, and External Reference context when valid, but they do not silently inherit stale status, completion evidence, or modeled effects that no longer apply.

External References are preserved by linking the external object to the new Container when it represents the larger work and to child Tasks only when the external object supports, evidences, or projects that specific child. The original Task's historical External References are not rewritten; new `supersedes`, `projection_of`, `supports`, or `evidence_for` references may be added according to the accepted External Reference model.

GitHub-linked Task decomposition should keep the GitHub Issue or PR traceable to the Container and add child-level External References only for actionable subwork that needs projection or reconciliation.

Automation/Super Automation expansion uses the same structural-replacement rule; worker-specific child Task details are in §25.1.2.
```

#### DESIGN.md §21.2.1 — Phase 1b advisory candidate lifecycle

```markdown
#### 21.2.1 Phase 1b advisory candidate lifecycle

An `AdvisoryCandidate` is the first-class object form for Phase 1b review-queue proposals, including tag, dependency, preference, decomposition, clarification-question, and other advisory outputs before admission. It is `candidate_state`, not admitted state, until an admission decision creates the ordinary canonical mutation or review event.

The minimum record contains `advisory_candidate_id`, `schema_version`, `candidate_kind`, lifecycle state, object version, target or scope refs, normalized proposal shape, payload ref or redacted payload summary, source evidence refs or hashes, confidence, per-field provenance, proposed/effective time or interval, proposing actor or model/tool metadata, origin Device and execution-context provenance, idempotency key, optional suppression key, `compartment_ids`, a review-visible Compartment label or redacted label, disclosure and retention policy, review order metadata, and correction, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, admission, or archive links. Candidates are per-object records rather than aggregate queue blobs so each candidate can be versioned, replicated, redacted, and reviewed under its own Compartment policy.

Lifecycle states are `proposed`, `deferred`, `resurfaced`, `admitted`, `rejected`, `superseded`, and `archived`. New candidates start as `proposed`; `proposed` candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred, superseded, or archived. Deferred candidates may become `resurfaced`, rejected, superseded, or archived. Resurfaced candidates may be admitted, rejected, deferred again, superseded, or archived. Admitted, rejected, and superseded candidates remain historical records and may later be archived according to retention policy; archiving is not erasure unless a separate redaction or deletion policy permits it.

Unadmitted candidates may influence only review surfaces: ordering, grouping, explanations, deduplication diagnostics, clarification prompts, local suggestions, and explicitly labeled preview diffs. They must not mutate Tasks, tags, dependencies, decompositions, clarification answers, Preferences, Logs, Snapshots, Plans, Calendars, Relationships, Associations, projection state, capability grants, disclosure policy, external messages, or external actions. They must not become hidden planner constraints. Enforcement is by requiring admitted-state reducers, planners, projection writers, and mutation call sites to consume only admitted canonical objects or explicit preview inputs, while candidate reads remain scoped to review APIs that preserve candidate-state labels and Compartment policy.

Deferral preserves an unresolved proposal without treating it as false. A deferred candidate may resurface only on materially new evidence, user request, a policy-triggered review interval, a relevant accepted change to the candidate target or dependencies, or arrival of a clarification or external reference that directly changes reviewability. Resurfacing links the prior deferral, trigger evidence, and reason the old deferral no longer controls; it creates a review item and never admits the candidate automatically.

Rejection is durable correction metadata. A rejected candidate retains a privacy-minimized suppression record containing candidate kind, normalized proposal shape, target and scope shape, Compartment and redaction class, evidence hashes or source fingerprints, extractor/model/schema version, prompt or template digest when relevant, rejection reason or user correction, deciding actor Identity, `authority_source`, decided-at time, retention or purge policy, and the suppression key. The rejected payload may be redacted or purged under retention policy once the suppression record is sufficient; retaining the key must not make the rejected proposal accepted, exportable, more visible, or usable as evidence that the rejected content was true.

Admission, rejection, deferral, resurfacing, supersession, and archival decisions are first-class review events carrying actor Identity, `authority_source`, origin Device, observed candidate version, observed policy versions when policy is relied on, effective time, recorded time, idempotency key, and links to resulting canonical mutations or replacement candidates. Admission emits the ordinary sync-ready mutation envelope for the admitted object change; rejection emits the decision event and suppression record without creating the proposed canonical state.

Review order never changes state category. Proposed and resurfaced candidates may be prioritized ahead of deferred or archived records, but a contested region remains `candidate_state` or `pending_state` until an admission or conflict-resolution event is itself admitted. UI, APIs, derived previews, and reports must label candidate diffs as candidate or preview material and must not present them as `admitted_state` merely because they are high priority, old, repeated, or uncontested in the queue.

#### DESIGN.md §1 — Overview

```markdown
## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system for implementing life logistics.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, Resource availability, Skill capability, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. Its core motivation is to help an individual human being plan and implement the logistics of an actual life: what matters, what must happen, what the world must contain, what the user is capable of doing, what can be learned, what should be bought or delegated, and what should happen next. Organizational coordination is an important emergent property of the same model, not the root purpose.

The canonical UbU use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The canonical use-case statement: UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution. UbU's purpose is not merely to schedule time, but to help the user determine what path can realistically move life from the current state toward the desired state.

The deeper purpose is to help people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose — not just to schedule it.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md — referenced sections

#### DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §4 — Core definitions

```markdown
## 4. Core definitions

### Device **(net-new)**

A `Device` is a UbU execution enclave, not merely physical hardware. Examples: phone,
laptop, desktop, home server, browser session, removable sync-bundle importer, personal
GPU worker, temporary recovery environment.

### Zone **(net-new)**

A `Zone` is a user-controlled replication and work-context boundary — not a server.
Examples: personal Zone, household Zone, UbU project Zone, work/client Zone, experimental
Zone.

### Compartment

A `Compartment` is an existing UbU model noun (already referenced in the Phase 0 cutlist
as a deferred Phase 1+ model). In Phase 0 it surfaces only as `compartment_ids:
list[str]` and `redaction_level: str` on `PrivacyAndProvenance`. Phase 2 introduces a
**Compartment policy object** (replication/routing/retention/export) that references
compartments by the same `compartment_ids` convention. The policy object itself is
net-new; the compartment id vocabulary is not.

### SyncStatement **(net-new)**

A `SyncStatement` is a signed or integrity-protected state-change envelope exchangeable
through many transports.

### Replica **(net-new)**

A `Replica` is the local state view held by a Device. It may be full, partial, redacted,
stale, or restricted.

### Admitted state

Admitted state is the deterministic result of applying accepted sync statements, policy
updates, corrections, and conflict-resolution statements according to this contract's
causality and conflict rules. See §9 for the precise determinism claim.
